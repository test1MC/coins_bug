        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 ">Overview</h1>
        <p class="Body">COINS&#160;OA users now have the ability to consolidate invoice comments into a single text area from the <span class="Function"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Orders caps"></MadCap:variable></span> function.    The consolidated comments can then be edited before being seen on an invoice.  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Invoice comments are printed once per invoice, after the invoice totals.   Comments that appear on the invoice are set up in the <span class="Function">Comment Types </span>function in <i>Service Management &gt; Setup &gt; Configurable Setup</i>.</li>
            <li>COINS&#160;OA consolidates similar comments, so that all Problem Code descriptions are consolidated into a single comment, and  all Resolution comments are consolidated into a single comment.  Service Reports and Invoices then use the new consolidated comment, allowing applicable data to print at designated locations within the document.</li>
        </ul>
