    <h1 MadCap:autonum="2 ">Consolidation Best Practice</h1>
    <p class="Body">You can define how to best implement consolidation to suit your billing needs.    When a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Order caps" /> is billed multiple times, you might want to consider changing the Comment Type on the original consolidated comment(s) to the Comment Type used on the original source records.    These consolidated comments would then not carry forward on subsequent invoices.    New consolidated comments can then be created that represent the information that should be shown on the next invoice.</p>
