        <p class="Body">The Mobile device allows input of the Refrigerant Circuit, as shown in <MadCap:xref href="#MobileRefrigCircuit" class="ImageRef"><i>Figure 1:  Refrigerant Circuit in Mobile</i></MadCap:xref>. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Visit caps" /> Detail provides access to that data. If you have not referenced a Circuit, the system looks for the first matching Circuit with a Refrigerant Type equal to the Material Code on the transaction. Since most units contain the same Refrigerant in all of their Circuits, it is likely that a non-defined transaction is related to Circuit #1.</p>
        <p class="Body">If a match by Material Code cannot be made, the report references the first Circuit with a non-zero Capacity. It is recommended that you reference the Circuit number in order to obtain accurate Leak Rate values.</p>
