        <p class="Body">Previously, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Order caps" /> Revenue in the OA&#160;Service&#160;Management module could be calculated based on Billings, Sum of Detail Lines, or Percent Complete Method. However, none of these methods was adequate for incomplete <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Orders caps" /> without budgets, which were either billed multiple times or billed in a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Financial Period caps" /> different from when a cost was incurred. To provide for the ability to handle these incomplete Service Orders, a <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText><strong>C </strong>(Cost Multiplier) Revenue Recognition Method (RRM) is available in Service Management.</p>
        <p class="Body">This Cost Multiplier RRM&#160;is applicable for Service Orders only<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly"> and is discussed in more detail in this document</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
