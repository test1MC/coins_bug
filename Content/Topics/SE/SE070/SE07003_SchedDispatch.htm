        <p>Add a right mouse option to the Visit cell:&#160;Send Text/Email to Location Contacts. This would be similar to the current Sent Text which needs to be relabeled Sent Text to Technician.</p>
        <p>[image here]</p>
        <p>The dialog accepts input of text to send as both text or email to all Location Contacts that have the "Visit Scheduled" notification turned on. The system will send the message based on the method defined for the contact.</p>
        <p>This option would allow the dispatcher to manually handle text/email notifications that might be confusing to the customer. For example, the system automatically sent two messages stating that Tech A has been scheduled. And then Tech B has been scheduled. Tech A was actually unscheduled, but no message was sent. In this case, the dispatcher might want to send a message that explains the “why” a different tech has been scheduled.</p>
