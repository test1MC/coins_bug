        <h1><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Order caps" /> Groups</h1>
        <p class="Body">The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Order caps" /> Group record previously had a <span class="Field">Minimum Scheduled Hours </span>field meant to serve as the default for a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Visit caps" />’s Scheduled Hours.   Since the value for this field was a default, "Minimum" was not a good term to use.    In addition, this one field served as a default for both PM and Non-PM <MadCap:variable name="Variables.se visits" />, which was not practical.    To remedy this, the following changes were made in the <span class="Function"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Order caps" /> Groups </span>function and are shown in <MadCap:xref href="#SvcOrderGrps" class="ImageRef"><i>Figure 2:  [%=Variables.Se Service Order caps%] Groups</i></MadCap:xref>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimum Scheduled Hours was relabelled as <span class="Field">Default Non-PM <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Visit caps" /> Scheduled Hours</span>.</li>
            <li>A <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText><span class="Field">Default PM <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Visit caps" /> Scheduled Hours </span>field was added.</li>
