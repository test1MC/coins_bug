        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p class="Body">Service Management is sometimes used by COINS OA users for small projects that are not traditional Service work.  These particular users do not use Mobile Technician or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Visit caps" /> Details functionality to capture cost information on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Order caps" />.</p>
        <p class="Body">When billing <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Labour caps" />, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Order caps" /> detail lines are typically generated from posted PR Timecards.  One of the key data elements on the Timecard is the PR Trade, which is often overridden during Timecard entry to accurately capture the type of work performed by an employee.</p>
        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">Changes have been made in Service Management that incorporate the PR Trade into <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Labour caps" /> Billing Rate functionality, therefore allowing  users to better use <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Orders caps" /> for smaller projects. These changes are discussed in this document.</p>
