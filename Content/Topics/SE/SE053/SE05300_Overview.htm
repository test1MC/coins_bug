        <p class="Body">The COINS OA Service Management module <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">now </MadCap:conditionalText>allows you to bill two Customers from a single <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Order caps" />. This includes the ability to collect an on-site payment from the Customer who owns that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Order caps" />. For example, residential customers with a home warranty require the home owner to pay a deductible, with the balance billed to the home warranty company. (This does not include the storage of the deductible amount or have a price schedule established with the warranty company.)

        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">This document explains the changes that have been made so that billing two Customers can work correctly in COINS&#160;OA.</p>
