        <p class="Body">Beginning with COINS&#160;OA&#160;v11.07, the Inception Date was considered an Add-only field.   However, the ability to access the Inception Date in Update mode was reintroduced in v11.09. As a result, you can now change the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Agreement caps" /> Inception Date when certain criteria are met.</p>
        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">This document describes the changes that were made in COINS&#160;OA to provide this functionality.</p>
