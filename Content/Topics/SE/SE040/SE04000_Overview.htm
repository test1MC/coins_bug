        <p class="Body">Since Service Management uses a common Costing <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" />, it could not reference a specific Line of Business and/or Profit Center. As a result, users could only create multiple Cost Codes where the G/L Elements were hardcoded, and the   Cost Codes for a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Order caps" /> could only be masked based on the data available in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Status. In a typical situation, Cost Codes used the Natural Account from the Standard Cost Type file, combining it with the other G/L Elements from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" />/Section.   </p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">This process has been improved, so that users now have the ability to </MadCap:conditionalText>
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.ScreenOnly">Users can </MadCap:conditionalText>set up G/L Account Masking directly within Service Management.    The Masking information within Service can be used during Cost Code creation, thus blending the G/L Elements defined in Service with the Natural Account in the Standard Cost Type file.</p>
