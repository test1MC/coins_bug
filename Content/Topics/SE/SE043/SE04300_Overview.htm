        <p class="Body">Previously, the <span class="Field">Default Daily Hours </span>field in Payroll <span class="Function">Company Configuration </span>was un<MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed, because time was input into COINS via <span class="Function">Load Timesheets</span>. However, there was a problem when transferring timesheets from SE <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Visits caps" /> because Daily Hour values were not being populated. Also, if the <span class="Field">Default Daily Hours </span>field was <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed, the effort to modify all of the templates in use would be quite large and pose a risk for error.</p>

This allows COINS&#160;OA&#160;users to implement Daily Reports (mCDRs), transfer timesheets from&#160;SE&#160;<MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Visits caps" /> that include populated Daily Hour values, and be able to use existing templates for <span class="Function">Load Timesheets</span>.</p>
