<div class="param_def">
<p>(Australian payroll only) A list of leave types which are accrued in the system.</p>
<p>This is used by the <span class="function">Leave Liability Reports </span>which show the leave liability of employees accrued till a particular date.</p>
<p>Typical values would normally be <span class="userinput">HOL,SIC,LSL,RDO</span> (denoting the following types of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holidays"/> that are accrued for employees):<br />HOL - Annual Leave<br />SIC ? Sick Leave<br />LSL ? Long Service Leave<br />RDO ? Roster day off</p>
<p>Or for example if you have more than one leave type that denotes annual leave, you could have values like: <span class="userinput wrap">HO36, HO38, SI36, SI38, LS36, LS38, RD36, RD38, PUB</span> to denote different annual leaves accrued due to work done on 36 hour weekly contract, 38 hour weekly contract, and so on.</p>
