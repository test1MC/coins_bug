<p>The files that COINS creates during a submission attempt will be held in a subdirectory of this root directory. COINS creates the subdirectory automatically with the same name as the 'message class', which is HMRC-PAYE-RTI. COINS also copies the submission file to Document Management.</p>
<p>All users who will send the Internet submissions will require permissions to read and write from this directory.</p>
