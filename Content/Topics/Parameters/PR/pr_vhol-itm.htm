<span class="parameter">PR/VHOL-ITM - </span> Variable Holiday Item Number
</div>
<div class="param_def">
<P>The number of a pay item that will be used to store the factor to multiply fixed <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday"/> items by (if you need to vary the number of weeks over which to average <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday"/>).</P>
<P>An example of this would be a sickness insurance scheme, where the amount payable is based on weeks worked, however during <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday"/> the number of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday"/> weeks is based on the number of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday"/> hours the employee has accrued rather than the physical time off. In this instance the number of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday"/> periods can be calculated within the items, the result is assigned to the item specified by VHOL ITM, and this value plus one (to account for the normal week being paid) is then used as the multiplier.</P>
