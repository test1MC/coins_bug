<p>A list of items giving employee pension contributions not paid under net pay arrangements (those included in the taxable pay).</p>
<p>Where a payment is made to an item in this list via a pension scheme set up as being tax deductible that will override this setting and allocate the payment to the pension paid under a net pay arrangement. It may be necessary to include the item in this list rather than the <FONT color="#000000"><SPAN class="parameter">PENNOTAX </SPAN>list as other pension schemes which are not set up as being tax deductible may also use the same item.</FONT></p>
