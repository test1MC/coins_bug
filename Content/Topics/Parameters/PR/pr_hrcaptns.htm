<div class="param_def">
<p>A list of the HR captions you want to be made available to the calculation, as constants. </p>
<p>Note you cannot use caption codes that begin with a numeric.  Also symbols in the code could be incompatible with the calculation logic.  It is safe to use codes that are alpha-numeric and begin alpha, for example "A1".</p>
