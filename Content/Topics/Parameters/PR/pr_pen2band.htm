<div class="param_def">
<P>For pension schemes with split costing, you can enter a can-do list of pension scheme numbers that will use the split costing.</P>
<P>In the maintenance of a scheme that has split costs, there are up to four bandwidths of pay. For each bandwidth you have two employee rates and two employers rates. The new routine Pension Default Costs allows you to set up a default costing for each rate.</P>
