<span class="parameter">HS/CANRESIN - </span> Allow cancellation of incomplete reservations
</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>Whether reservations can be cancelled and deleted before the Reservation Entry Complete (RESCOMP) event has been run on the <span class="function">Sales Workbench</span>. This allows a reservation to be cancelled in COINS more efficiently and prevents author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is"/>ation workflows from being triggered on a reservation that will not be progressed.</p>
<p>If this is set to <span class="userinput">Y</span>, the Cancel Sale event is available on the <span class="function">Sales Workbench</span> options menu, and the reservation event can be deleted from the History tab without getting an error.</p>
