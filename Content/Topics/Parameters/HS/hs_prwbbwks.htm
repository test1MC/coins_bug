<span class="parameter">HS/PRWBBWKS - </span> Brickwork construction stages (OA)
</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>A comma-separated list of construction stages that represent brickwork stages.  This is then used to calculate a brickwork complete percentage based on the number of completed brickwork stages divided by the total number of brickwork stages.  This can be reported in the <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS4130RVSI">Construction Gantt Chart</span>.</p>
<p>This is useful for timber frame construction where the brickwork stages are not on the critical path and therefore have no duration in the construction <MadCap:variable name="Variables.programme"/>.</p>
