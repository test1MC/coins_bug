</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>Whether to include in the service charge period plots that have been completed in the middle of the period.</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput">Y</span> = Plots that have been legally completed during the service charge period you are billing are included.  The charge is pro-rated.  Charges that have already been billed will not be included.</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput">N</span> = Plots that have been completed during the period you are billing are not included.</p>
<p>If you are billing in arrears, this parameter should be set to <span class="userinput">Y</span>.</p>
<p>If billing in advance, it depends on how the completion statement is configured:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the completion statement is configured to include the charges, set this to <span class="userinput">N</span>.</li>
<li>If the charges are not included on the configuration statement, set this to <span class="userinput">Y</span>.</li>
