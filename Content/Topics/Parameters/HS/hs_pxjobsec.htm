<p>(<MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/COINSOA.flsnp"/> only) Whether to restrict the view of Part Exchange properties so a user can only see properties where they have access to the associated <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract"/> (<SPAN class="userinput">Y</SPAN> or <SPAN class="userinput">N</SPAN>).</p>
<p>Note that, for performance reasons on the By Purchaser tab, all purchasers will still be shown, but a link to the relevant property will only be available where the user has access to the associated <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract"/>.</p>
