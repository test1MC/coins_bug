</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>Allows you to specify groups of COINS <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies"/> which should operate their own People Information Workbench. By default, COINS operates with one combined People Information Workbench for all your COINS <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies"/>.</p>
<P>For example, if you set this parameter as follows:</P>
<P>1,2,3|4,5|6</P>
<P>This would result in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies"/> 1, 2 and 3 operating under a single combined PIW. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Kco companies caps"/> 4 and 5 would also operate under a single PIW, but this would be separate from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies"/> 1, 2, 3 and 6. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Kco company caps"/> 6 would operate with its own PIW.</P>
