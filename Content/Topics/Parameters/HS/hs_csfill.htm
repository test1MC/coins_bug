<p>A can-do list of construction methods for which earlier stages are auto-completed.</p>
<p><UL>
<LI>For plots with a construction method included in this parameter, a construction stage event will be automatically created for each incomplete earlier construction stage when a later construction stage is recorded as complete (so that there are no gaps in the recorded stages (within the list which is applicable to the build <MadCap:variable name="Variables.programme"/> for the plot)).  All fields (other than the construction stage) on these events will be set the same as for the construction stage event actually being recorded.</LI>
<LI>If this is left blank or for plots with a construction method not included in this parameter then COINS will work dependent on the settings of HS parameters <FONT color="#000000"><SPAN class="parameter">CSDUP </SPAN>and </FONT><FONT color="#000000"><SPAN class="parameter">CSSEQ</SPAN>. </FONT></LI></UL>
<P class="noteheader">NOTE</P>
<DIV class="note">For plots with a construction method included in parameter <FONT color="#000000"><SPAN class="parameter">CSFILL</SPAN>, this will effectively override the setting of parameter </FONT><FONT color="#000000"><SPAN class="parameter">CSSEQ </SPAN>as any gaps will be automatically filled.  However, parameter </FONT><FONT color="#000000"><SPAN class="parameter">CSDUP </SPAN>works in conjunction with </FONT><FONT color="#000000"><SPAN class="parameter">CSFILL </SPAN>? controlling whether a user can input the same stage as currently recorded for the plot.</FONT></DIV></p>
