<span class="parameter">SY/WEBINFO - </span> Users to receive exception info
</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>A list of users who receive enhanced error messages with additional information including program/method details of where the error occurred.</p>
<p>This information is useful to developers, but could also be a security risk, so <span class="parameter">WEBINFO</span> allows you to control who has access to the additional information.</p>
<p>The default, blank, means that no one gets the extra information. This is the safest setting.</p>
<p><span class="userinput">*</span> would send the extra information to all users.</p>
<p>The intention is that you would usually leave this blank (the safest option) and perhaps set it to a single user ID if you needed to see the specific information for a user.</p>
