<p>The default for how COINS remembers the advanced filter settings on <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/coinsoa.flsnp"/> browse screens.</p>
<p>When a user opens a browse screen that they have used previously, COINS can pre-fill the advanced filter with the last settings they entered.  This controls how long COINS remembers the settings.</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userselect">Full</span> = Always remember filter settings.</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userselect">Day</span> = Remember filter settings from earlier today (first time on each page would show no filters).</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userselect">Session</span> = Remember filter settings from the current session only (first time on each page since login would show no filters).</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userselect">None</span> = Never remember filter settings (advanced filters always show blank first time on a page).</p>
<p>You can change the setting for an individual user in <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBSUR">Users</span>.</p>
