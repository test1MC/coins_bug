<div class="param_def">
<P>A list of COINS messages to include in the log file.</P>
<P>This is a can-do list of COINS messages (in the format xx999; for example <SPAN class="userinput Wrap">SY617, SY618, SY619</SPAN>). If a user receives a message on screen or in a report that is in this list, that message will be written to the log file (WebSpeed log for pages/screens, report log for reports) with a tag alongside it of <STRONG>COINSErrorMessage </STRONG>and showing the program stack. This can be used to monitor for certain messages being raised. </P>
<P>There is a similar check that checks for System Error messages (which are specifically unexpected issues that the programmer has written a throwSystemError() message for). These are shown in the log file (regardless of this parameter) with <STRONG>COINSSystemError </STRONG>as a tag.</P>
<P>Both these tags can be searched for in the log file (using OE Management or other tools) to alert the system administrator to issues.</P>
