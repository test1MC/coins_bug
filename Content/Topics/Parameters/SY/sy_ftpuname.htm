<p>(COINS<SUP>plus</SUP> only) The user name of an account that allows access to the COINS host computer using FTP.
<P></P></p>
<p>COINS Print Previewer and a number of COINS programs (such as syget, syput and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.eft"/> transfer) require FTP access to the COINS host computer. If you have a security policy that prevents regular COINS users accessing the host computer through FTP, set up a special FTP account (typically with no telnet login) and enter the username and password here. The programs that need FTP access will know about the account through these parameters, but it will be hidden from normal users.</p>
