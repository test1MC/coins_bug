<span class="parameter">SY/LDAPTIME - </span> LDAP Authentication Timeout
</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>The LDAP authentication timeout (in seconds).</p>
<p>The default timeout period used by COINS LDAP authentication when communicating with your network's LDAP servers is dependent on the network configuration of the COINS server. In some cases, where LDAP servers are listed in your network domain name resolution services but are not responding to authentication requests, it can cause login times to be extended.</p>
<p>To resolve extended login times, you can set an overriding LDAP authentication timeout period, in seconds, using this parameter.</p>
<p>Ensure that you are aware of your network's performance before altering this parameter. Setting the value too low may result in authentication failures on poor performing networks and/or LDAP servers. For reliable, healthy networks and/or LDAP servers values down to two seconds can be used.</p>
