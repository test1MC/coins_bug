</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>A decimal value above which the rate is rounded to two decimal places instead of the usual four. Any rate lower than this is rounded to four decimals.</p>
<P>For example, if the cost is 0.011 and the mark-up is 10%, the sale price should be 0.0121. If this is rounded to two places, the result, 0.01, is less than the cost. So low values should be rounded to four places.</P>
<P>However, for larger values it may not be appropriate to show so many decimals. For a cost of 123.45, with a mark-up of 5%, you would get 129.6225. This parameter now allows for rounding with the desired number of decimals.</P>
