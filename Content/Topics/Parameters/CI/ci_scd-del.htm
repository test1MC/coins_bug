<div class="param_def">
<p>The status code to use for 'deleted' companies (that is, companies that have been removed from lookups etc. for example due to company mergers). These companies are still in the database, but users should never see them; the status code is really only there in case the data needs to be recovered.</p>
<P>Set up the possible values for status types using <span class="function" title="Function:%WCI2130BCCA">Status Codes (Group Wide)</span>.</P>
