<p>Parameters beginning <SPAN class="parameter">ADD </SPAN>identify the names you have given to different types of address (using <SPAN class="procedure">Address Type Maintenance</SPAN>). Because you can choose whichever names you want for address types, you must use these parameters to inform COINS which names you have used. The possible values for company types can be found in the Procurement menu, Construction and Civils, Setup, Company Information Systems, Company Types. Company types can be set up in Company Type Maintenance.</p>
