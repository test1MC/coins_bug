<p>The number of lines that are available on bill item dimension (DIM) sheets.</p>
<p>This should not be set to more than 30 as higher settings can cause problems with the operation of the DIM sheets.  The recommended setting is between 10 and 15 unless users require more lines in which case it can be increased up to 30. </p>
