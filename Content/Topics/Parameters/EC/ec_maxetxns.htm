<div class="param_def">
<p>The limits for the number of eInvoice, Order Confirmation or eGRN transactions that are aggregated into any one batch.</p>
<P>The eWorkbenches aggregate individual messages received so that the length of the list displayed is made shorter. This allows you to limit the number of transactions that are aggregated.</P>
<P>Set one, two or three values in a pipe-separated list. The first value limits the eInvoice batch size, the second the Order Confirmation batch size and the third the eGRN batch size. (A zero value or no value indicates that no limit is in place.)</P>
