<p>How COINS responds if a user enters an order for a trade that is not listed as one of the capabilities of the office against which the order is being raised.</p>
<P>This would be useful if you use capabilities to record which trades each subcontractor performs, and want to prevent users raising inappropriate orders.</P>

<P class="yesnolist"><SPAN class="userinput">E</SPAN> = COINS issues an error and will not allow the trade to be ordered.</P>
