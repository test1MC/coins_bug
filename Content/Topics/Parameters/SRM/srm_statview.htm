<div class="param_def">
<p>The level at which you want to amend status codes. </p>
<p class="yesnolist">blank = You are not using the option to amend status codes at a specified level.  The Company Information Workbench shows <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company"/>-specific and group status codes; in SRM, the tabs that companies appear on depend on the Group status.</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput"><em>n</em></span> = The "status by view" level, that is, the level at which users can amend the status codes.  Users at a different view level will not be able to amend the codes.  Where different companies have been given different status codes at the same level, the higher level view will show the lowest status.  For example, the Crawley branch has given Southern Brick Supplies a status of Preferred, but the Slough branch has given it a status of Approved.  The South Regional office will see Southern Brick Supplies with a status of Approved, because that is lower than Preferred (see <span class="parameter">SCD-PREF</span>, <span class="parameter">SCD-APP</span>).</p>

<p>If you are using one of the "status by view" settings, you <strong>must</strong> define your organ<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is"/>ational structure using <span class="function" title="Function:%WCI9001BCRG">Organ<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is"/>ation Structure</span>.</p>
