<p>How COINS connects with the iPortal (Foreground or Background).</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userselect">Background </span>= (and if the background task srmu002.p is running), data that is waiting to be sent to COINS is processed in the background, and users will not experience any delay when visiting or refreshing a screen on the <span class="procedure">iPortal Monitor</span>.  The New Companies and Amended Companies will display whatever data has been processed.  </p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userselect">Foreground</span> = COINS contacts the iPortal more or less every time an <span class="procedure">iPortal Monitor</span> screen is visited or refreshed.  If there is a lot of information waiting to be sent to COINS, users may experience a long delay whilst this data is processed and stored in COINS.  </p>
<p>We recommend that during the initial testing phase this parameter should be set to <span class="userselect">Foreground</span>.  Once all issues have been resolved, this can be set to <span class="userselect">Background</span>.</p>
