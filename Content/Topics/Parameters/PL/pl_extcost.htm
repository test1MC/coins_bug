<p>Whether you are using externally costed invoices.</p>
<p>The Externally Costed Invoices feature allows you to identify <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts"/> as using externally costed invoices. These <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts"/> will not be costed within the COINS <SPAN class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps"/></SPAN>; invoices will be registered, and eventually the costs associated with them will be imported into COINS. <SPAN class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps"/></SPAN> will prevent the costing of invoices belonging to any such <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts"/>.</p>
