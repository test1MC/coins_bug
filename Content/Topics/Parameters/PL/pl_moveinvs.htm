<div class="param_def">
<p>Select <SPAN class="userinput">Y </SPAN>to turn on the Move PL Invoices to Another Batch function, which allows invoices in an unposted PL invoice entry batch to be moved to another unposted invoice entry batch.</p>
<p>The purpose of this is to allow invoices that are not yet ready to be posted (because they need reviewing or re-negotiating with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers"/>) to be moved to another batch without holding up the posting of the remaining invoices in the batch.</p>
