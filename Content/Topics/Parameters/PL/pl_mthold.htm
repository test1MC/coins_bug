</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p><span class="userinput">Y</span> = Invoices with missing tickets are put on hold automatically.</p>
<p>During invoice matching, users can (if allowed) enter missing tickets. Putting invoices with missing tickets on hold automatically prevents the invoice being paid.  If <span class="function" title="Function:%WPO1810BPGM">Missing Ticket Workbench</span> is being used, this allows site personnel to corroborate that the goods were actually received, and takes the invoice off hold if there are no other problems.</p>
