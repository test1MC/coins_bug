</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>The number of days before and after today's date during which users may enter a verification date.</p>
<P>Enter the number of days before today and after today, separated by a comma.  For example, <SPAN class="userinput">10,30</SPAN> would allow verification dates up to 10 days before today and up to 30 days after today.</P>
<P>This allows you to apply validation to the verification date, to avoid mis-typed dates.  HMRC notification of a change in a subcontractor's status will typically allow a number of days to implement the change. Consequently the date entered could be the date on the letter itself (in the past) or a date which may allow the subcontractor's current payment to go through with the current status (a date in the future). A mis-typed date, say for a different year, could result in a change in status not coming into effect appropriately.</P>
