<p>Whether to include in tax returns all payments made to PL subcontractors or only payments with a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour"/> value.</p>
<P>When making payments to PL Subcontractors, details of all payments made should be included in tax returns. This is to include non <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour"/> only payments. It is possible that some PL Subcontractors may have individual agreements with HMRC regarding including non <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour"/> only payments. </P>
<P class="yesnolist"><SPAN class="userinput">Y</SPAN> = All payments made to PL subcontractors regardless of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour"/> element or not will be included in tax returns. If at the time of making a payment or scheduling a payment and the subcontractor is not verified, then an error will be given and no payments (regardless of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour"/> value) will be allowed to be made or scheduled for payment. </P>
<P class="yesnolist"><SPAN class="userinput">N</SPAN> = Payments made to PL Subcontractors which have a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour"/> value will be included in tax returns. </P>
