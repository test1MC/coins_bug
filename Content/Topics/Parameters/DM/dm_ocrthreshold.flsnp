</div>
        <p>The percentage confidence required for a value read by OCR to be accepted as valid.</p>
        <p>The OCR process uses various criteria, including the length and format of the data that is read and a confidence score from the OCR engine, to assign a confidence percentage to each value read. If a value has a confidence percentage below what is set in <span class="parameter">OCRTHRESHOLD</span>, it is rejected as invalid.</p>
