<span class="parameter">JC/QFORCH1 - </span> Quick Forecast Cost Heads &amp; Cats - Costs
</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>A comma-separated list of "dummy" <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost heads"/> and categories to be used when entering the forecast to complete Cost figures on the Monthly Review screen. For example: <SPAN class="userinput">LX999.LA,MX999.MA,SX999.SC,PX999.PL</SPAN></p>
<p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost heads"/> must be valid standard <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost heads"/>, but you must prevent costs being posted to them (for example, by leaving the G/L code blank or giving them a class that is not allowed on <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts"/>). 
<P></P>
<P>COINS uses the descriptions on these <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost heads"/> as the descriptions for the lines on the Monthly Review screen. You can have as many <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost heads"/> as necessary; however, only the first three (or five if you are not displaying the GP Adjustment field; see <SPAN class="parameter">FOHIDE</SPAN>) will be shown on the Commercial Summary screen - the remaining lines will be summar<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is"/>ed under the fourth (or sixth) heading.</P>
<P>On the Monthly Review screen, actual costs come from the cost codes that are linked to these "dummy" codes; see <SPAN class="parameter">FORQCON</SPAN>.</P></p>
