<span class="parameter">JC/COMBINE - </span> Combined Forecasting and Business Plan ?
</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>Allows you to combine some of the functionality of Business Plan into Forecasting. More specifically this means that you can spread the final forecast during the Monthly Review session.</p>
<p>If this parameter is set to <span class="userinput">Y</span>, you will no longer be able to access the Business Plan screens.</p>
<p>If this is set no <span class="userinput">N</span>, COINS will not require you to spread the final forecast, and will not show the <span style="background-color: yellow; color: navy;">&lt;</span> highlights against lines that have not been fully spread.</p>
