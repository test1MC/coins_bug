<span class="parameter">JC/DAYSWARN - </span> Days warning before retired activity raises an error
</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>The number of days that you can still enter time against an activity after it has retired. During this time, COINS issues a warning rather than an error. Setting <span class="parameter">DAYSWARN </span>to a high number will effectively mean you only ever get a warning.</p>
