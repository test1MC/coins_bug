<div class="param_def">
<p>The ASCII code for the character to begin reference numbers generated from year 2000 onwards.</p>
<p>This allowed you to specify a start character for automatically-generated INTREF type fields based on the year, so that the records appeared in order.  For example, reference numbers would begin 99 in 1999 and, say, A in 2000.  This is not required for new installations of COINS after 2000.</p>
