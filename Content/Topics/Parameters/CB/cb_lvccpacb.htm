</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>Y = When Customer Cash is distributed to either the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sales Ledger caps"/> or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales caps"/> Ledger and the amount  entered does not get fully allocated, then the portion that is left will post to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cash Book caps"/> as Customer Cash. I.e. The unallocated amount will stay in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cash Book caps"/>.</p>
<p>N = When Customer Cash is distributed to either the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sales Ledger caps"/> or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales caps"/> Ledger and the amount  entered does not get fully allocated, then the portion that is left will post to either the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sales Ledger caps"/> or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales caps"/> Ledger as unallocated cash.</p>
<p>When the parameter is set to Y, then if any Customer Cash is selected but cannot be fully distributed then there is no need to enter a 'CC' analysis line, as during posting the Customer Cash line will be generated automatically. This is designed to enable faster allocation of Customer Cash.</p>
