<div class="param_def">
<p>Whether to validate the closing balance for automatic bank statement loads (<span class="userinput">Y</span> or <span class="userinput">N</span>).</p>
<p>If this is set to <span class="userinput">Y</span>, for automatic bank statement loads an Opening Balance will be displayed - which is the closing balance from the previous bank statement - as well as a Closing Balance input field which will be mandatory. The user must enter the closing balance for the statement that is to be loaded. If the movement of the transactions on the load file does not agree with the closing balance entered, then the load file will be rejected and an error message will be output on the load report. </p>
