</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>Whether to use norm constants for material resources (<SPAN class="userinput">Y</SPAN> or <SPAN class="userinput">N</SPAN>).</p>
<P>Norm constants are used to define the time required to fit a material item.</P>
<P>For example, an electrical socket may have a quantity of 5 and a norm constant of .5, so the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Labour caps"/> hours to fit five sockets is (5 * .5) = 2.5 hrs. The 2.5 hours are auto filled in when the resource within the item is a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Labour caps"/>-related resource and materials on the item have been entered. </P>
<P>So if a user creates a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq boq"/> Item to install electrical <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant"/>, this will likely include a number of different electrical materials. Each will have a norm constant and the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour"/>er (who in this case would be an electrician) will know how many hours it will take so they can be charged out.</P>
