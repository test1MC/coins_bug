<div class="param_def">
<p>This allows you to print user-defined data (such as total budget for material costs and subcontract costs) at the head of each <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract"/> on the Order Placing Schedule.</p>
<p>The first entry is the name of a horizontal report which needs to be separately defined.  There can be up to six further entries, which identify the sequence numbers of columns from that report.  For example: <span class="userinput">ALLOWNCE,3,5,8</span>. The labels and values from the horizontal report will be included above the details for each <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract"/> in the <span class="procedure">Order Placing Schedule</span> or <span class="procedure">Order Placing Extract</span>.  These would typically refer to stored data that had been manually entered, but could refer to calculated amounts.</p>
<p>The first and second values (that is, the second and third entries in the parameter) must be the allowance for materials and subcontractors respectively; after each section (material/plant and subcontractors) of the report, there will be a line showing the outstanding balance, which is the difference between this allowance and the value of orders placed so far. </p>
