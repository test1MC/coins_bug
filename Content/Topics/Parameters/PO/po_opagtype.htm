<div class="param_def">
<p>The order type that identifies an e-commerce order with a linked price agreement.</p>
<p>When raising an open order of this type, you can link this to the price agreement, by entering the order number of the 'template' holding the price agreement. In the $F$%WPO9300SCOB
$F$, each line of the incoming order confirmation is validated, to ensure the product code is held in the agreement, and is the correct price.
<p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
<p class="note">The price agreement must be imported as a template order, so that the product code can be stored.</p> </p>
