<div class="param_def">
<p>Should COINS use the Standard <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps"/> Activities in place of Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) codes (<SPAN class="userinput">Y </SPAN>or <SPAN class="userinput">N</SPAN>)? If you set this to <SPAN class="userinput">Y</SPAN>, sections are not used and COINS validates WBS codes on orders against the activity codes. This allows you to use a set of standard activity codes (or "operation codes"), rather than having to set up WBS codes that are specific to a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract"/>.</p>
