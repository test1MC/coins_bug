<div class="param_def">
<p>A comma-separated list of the maximum number of days into the future GRN delivery date is valid.</p>
<p>The first entry determines how many days into the future automatically created GRNs can be dated. This applies when a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract"/> for an order is designated to have GRNs created automatically when ordering hourly-rated items.</p>
<p>The second entry determines how many days into the future manually entered GRNs can be dated. If no second entry is present, then zero days into the future is assumed.</p>
<p>For example, this parameter might be set to &ldquo;30,10&rdquo;.  This means that automatically created GRNs can be entered with dates 30 days into the future and manually entered GRNs can be dated 10 days in the future.</p>
