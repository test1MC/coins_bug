</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>The analysis level used in the commodity code lookup, if using analysis sets to look up commodity codes.</p>
<P>In order to look up commodities using analysis codes, the relevant codes need to be a hierarchy, so that codes at a lower level begin with codes from the next level up.  For example, codes at level 1: AA, AB; codes at level 2: AA111, AA112..., AB111, AB112...</P>
<P>The lookup can use all four analysis set levels, or a subset of them; for example, levels 1 and 2, or levels 3 and 4.</P>
<P class="yesnolist">blank = The lookup initially displays the descriptions from the highest available commodity analysis set level. The user selects one of these, and the lookup displays the descriptions for all codes at the next level that begin with the selected code.  The user then navigates down through analysis set levels until the bottom is reached. After the bottom level is reached, the lookup displays the commodity codes which match the selected analysis set.</P>
<P class="yesnolist"><SPAN class="userinput">S1, S2, S3 </SPAN>or <SPAN class="userinput">S4</SPAN> = This specifies a start point.  The lookup will initially display analysis descriptions from the specified level. The user then navigates down through analysis set levels until the bottom is reached. After the bottom level is reached, the lookup displays commodity codes which match the selected analysis set.</P>
<P class="yesnolist"><SPAN class="userinput">E1, E2, E3 </SPAN>or <SPAN class="userinput">E4</SPAN> = This specifies an end point. The lookup will initially display analysis descriptions from the highest level. The user then navigates through analysis set levels until the specified level is reached. After this specified level is reached, the lookup displays commodity codes which match the selected analysis set.</P>
