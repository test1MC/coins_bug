<div class="param_def">
<p>Whether to allow the WBS or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost head"/> category to be overridden during invoice matching (<span class="userinput">Y</span> or <span class="userinput">N</span>).</p>
<p>This is useful if matching of closed WBS or cost codes is prevented, as it allows users to change the closed code to an open code where necessary.</p>
