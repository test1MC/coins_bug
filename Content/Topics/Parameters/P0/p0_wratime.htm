<span class="parameter">p0/WRATIME - </span> Items with the hours per day of the week
</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>A list of seven items to which you input hours worked, one for each day of the week, in the order of Monday to Sunday. The employee's Working Rule Agreement (WRA) determines which hours to pay at basic, overtime and double time. The rated values are fed to the subtotals defined by <FONT color="#000000"><SPAN class="parameter">WRARATES</SPAN>, with cost analysis.</FONT></p>
<p>If the employee has less basic rate hours in the week than expected (including hours from <FONT color="#000000"><SPAN class="parameter">WRAMAKUP</SPAN>), then the premium hours will be reduced and paid at the basic rate to make up the basic hours.</FONT></p>
