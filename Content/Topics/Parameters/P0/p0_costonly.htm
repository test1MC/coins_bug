<p>Whether or not this is a costing only payroll.</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput">Y</span> = This payroll is used to record costing information only and not to actually pay anybody. Employees in this payroll will need to be linked to real employees in a normal payment payroll. The use of a costing only payroll is to allow more frequent posting of costing data to the financial ledgers than is possible on the employee's real pay frequency payroll.</p>
