<div class="param_def">
<p>When Shifts are allowed, you can specify a number of shifts (for example DAY &amp; NIGHT).  Time is then allocated as early, normal, overtime 1 or overtime 2, based on time slots.  So DAY shift might pay overtime 2 after 8pm.  This feature is only used in External Payments, such as those from FM, where the start and end times are specified.</p>
