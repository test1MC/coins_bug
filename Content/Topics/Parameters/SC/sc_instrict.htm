<div class="param_def">
<p>This allows you to ensure that all four standard insurance types are validated consistently.</p>
<p>This is only relevant if you are not using extended insurance validation (see <span class="parameter">EXTINS</span>).</p>
<p>Originally COINS only handled two insurance types (Public Liability and Employer Liability); this was extended to the four 'standard' types using the parameter <span class="parameter">SCADDINS</span>. However the payment processing was not checking these four insurance types consistently for being valid.</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput">Y</span> = COINS checks the validity of all insurance types the same way.</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput">N</span> = COINS checks the insurance in the same way it did before. This is provided to allow users to continue using existing settings.</p>
