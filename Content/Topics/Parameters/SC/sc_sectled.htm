<div class="param_def">
<p>Whether to run the <SPAN class="module">Subcontract Ledger</SPAN> on a sector basis (<SPAN class="userinput">Y</SPAN> or <SPAN class="userinput">N</SPAN>).</p>
<p>Running the ledger on a sector basis means that you can use the sector security system (in <SPAN class="module">General Ledger</SPAN>) to determine the data an individual user is allowed to work with. (For example, if a user has access to only one sector, they will only see certificates that belong to that sector.)</p>
