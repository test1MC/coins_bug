<div class="param_def">
<p>Select <span class="userinput">Y </span>to turn on the Move Certificates to Another Batch function, which allows certificates in an unposted SC Certificate entry batch to be moved to another unposted certificate entry batch.</p>
<p>The purpose of this is to allow certificates that are not yet ready to be posted (because they need reviewing or re-negotiating with SC Subcontractors) to be moved to another batch without holding up the posting of the remaining certificates in the batch.</p>
