</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>For subcontracts that are set up as self-billing, whether this only applies to certificates generated from <span class="module">VAP</span> green cards (<span class="userinput">Y</span> or <span class="userinput">N</span>).  If so, certificates <span>entered using standard certificate entry are treated as invoices. </span></p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput">Y</span> = Self-billing certificates generated from <span class="module">VAP</span> green cards are treated as self-billing; certificates entered in any other way (for example through the <span class="module">Subcontract Ledger</span>) are classified as Invoice.</p>
<p>Set this to <span class="userinput">Y</span> if you have a mixture of billing types on the same subcontract. This ensures that the correct tax point is applied to the transaction, allows recoverable <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat"/> to be posted correctly, and means the appropriate wording is included on the certificate print.</p>
