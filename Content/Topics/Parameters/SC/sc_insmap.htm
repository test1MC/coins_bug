<div class="param_def">
<p>When converting from old insurance to configurable insurance, this allows you to associate configurable insurance types with the four old insurance types, so you don't lose any data previously held. The old method is still available in <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/coinsplus.flsnp"/> and the four insurance types are kept in sync, so any reports that use the old method and have not changed will still work.</p>
<p>This is a pipe-separated list of the names of configurable insurance types that correspond to the four old insurance types.</p>
<p>Entry 1 = Public Liability; <br />Entry 2 = Employer Liability; <br />Entry 3 = Professional Indemnity; <br />Entry 4 = Contractors All Risk.</p>
<p>When you set up or update a configurable insurance type that has the same name as one of these entries, COINS loads policy data (insurer, policy number, limit amount and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.expiry"/> date) from the old insurance, and updates the old insurance automatically if the configurable insurance type changes.</p>
