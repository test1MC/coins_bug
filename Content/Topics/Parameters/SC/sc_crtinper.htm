<p>Whether to prevent users from entering a certificate date outside the batch period or the following one. This helps prevent user typing errors.</p>
<P>If this is set to Y then the certificate date entered cannot be earlier than the start of the batch period, or later than the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr effective date"/> of the period following the batch period. For example, if the batch period is 'January 2005', then the next period is 'February 2005' with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr effective date"/> 28/02/05. Any certificate dates later than 28/02/05 would be disallowed. </P>
<P>This helps prevent errors such as putting 02/02/07 instead of 02/02/05. If the wrong date is entered then the $P$AT|VAT$P$ is posted into the wrong tax point and cannot be reclaimed in the correct one. </P>
<P>If the certificate date is before the start date of the batch period, COINS issues a warning.</P>
