<p>(COINS OA only) Whether COINS validates the Billing Type for subcontractors that are not <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat"/> registered (<STRONG>Y</STRONG> or <STRONG>N</STRONG>).</p>
<P class="yesnolist"><SPAN class="userinput">Y</SPAN> = The subcontractor's billing type cannot be set to <SPAN class="userinput">A</SPAN> (Authenticated Receipt) or <SPAN class="userinput">S</SPAN> (Self Billing) if there is no <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat"/> registration number recorded for them.</P>
<P class="yesnolist"><SPAN class="userinput">N</SPAN> = COINS does not restrict the billing type for non-<MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat"/>-registered subcontractors.</P>
<P>We consider that it is good practice to have this set to <SPAN class="userinput">Y</SPAN>, since subcontractors who submit authenticated receipts or with self-billing agreements must be registered for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat"/>; however, clients with existing data that is not set up this way may need to set this to <SPAN class="userinput">N</SPAN>.</P>
