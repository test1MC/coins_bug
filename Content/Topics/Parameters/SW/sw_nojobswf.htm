<div class="param_def">
<p>When using FM Integration with an external dynamic scheduling tool (such as DRS), it is possible that the scheduling tool does not return the next task as expected.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When using FM Integration with an external dynamic scheduling tool (such as DRS), FM gets the currently-scheduled tasks from DRS via the Get Next Booking Report. If there are no tasks when the report runs, then if this parameter is set the report will automatically be re-run in the number of minutes set in the parameter.  This parameter allows a workflow to be triggered if no tasks are found after retrying.</p>
