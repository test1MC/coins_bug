<p>Text and fields that are added to the end of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm job"/> description, to help ensure that the correct <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm job"/> has been selected.</p>
<p>Fields entered here will automatically be displayed as a suffix to the brief description of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm job"/> wherever it is used on screens or reports. For example, adding <MadCap:variable name="Variables.swj_add__1"/> to <span class="parameter">DESCFLDS</span> will show address line 1 at the end of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm job"/> description. It is also possible to add text.</p>
<p>The JC section description and WBS description will also have the same suffix.</p>
