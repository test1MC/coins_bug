</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>Whether to print FM credit notes in single style (<span class="userinput">Y</span> or <span class="userinput">N</span>). This means that you get a separate credit note for each FM <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm job"/> and the invoice lines are at item level.</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput">Y</span> = There is a credit notes menu under the FM invoicing menu, containing a credit note workbench, generate report, and process and printing utilities. The <span class="function" title="Function:%WFM7003Uswj">Credit Note Generation</span> process takes all SOR items and cost transactions that are negative and have a credit type of 'Credit Note' and creates separate credit notes per FM <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm job"/> from them. The standard generate invoices process therefore only deals with positive values and items with negative values which have a credit type of 'invoice'.<br /><br />The print uses whatever style (consolidated, major category, cross <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract"/>) is set on the FM <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm job"/>.</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput">N</span> = The <span class="function" title="Function:%WFM7001Uswj1">Invoice Generation</span> process deals with both negative and positive valued items and includes them on the same invoice. It is only classed as a credit note where the total invoice amount is negative.</p>
