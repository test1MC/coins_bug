<div class="param_def">
<p>Do you want to allow one or more standard payment stages on a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost head"/> (<SPAN class="userinput">Y</SPAN> or <SPAN class="userinput">N</SPAN>)?</p>
<P>Usually this will be <SPAN class="userinput">Y</SPAN>; the <SPAN class="userinput">N</SPAN> setting is for compatibility with earlier versions.</P>
<P>Payment stages allows you to have a more detailed breakdown of your VAP budget, valuations and payments. For example, if you had a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost head"/> for Brickwork, you could set up payment stages for 1st lift, 2nd lift, etc.</P>
