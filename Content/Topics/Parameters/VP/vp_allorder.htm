<div class="param_def">
<p>A comma-separated list of build stages. COINS adds payment stages that are linked to these build stages to all orders for the appropriate trade (whether or not the payment stage has already been included on another order for the same plot).</p>
<p>This allows you to include, for example, a "dayworks" stage on all orders.</p>
