<div class="param_def">
<p>The number of days or months to age by in the CS Outstanding Retention Reports, such as 30 days or 1st of the month. These are the default settings; users can change them when they run the report.</p>
<p>For example, if you have configured the <span style="color: #000000;"><span class="parameter">RETTYPE </span>parameter to age by a specific number of days, and you entered <span class="userinput">30,60,90,120,150 </span>in </span><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="parameter">RETAGE</span>, this would result in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ageing"/> columns based on 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 days from the reporting date.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top: 2.75pt; margin-bottom: 2.75pt;">Alternatively, if you are <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ageing"/> by a fixed date in the month and enter, for example, <span class="userinput">28,28,28,28,28</span>, this would give you an <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ageing"/> period that was on the 28th of the corresponding month specified in the <span style="color: #000000;"><span class="parameter">RETTYPE </span>parameter.</span></p>
