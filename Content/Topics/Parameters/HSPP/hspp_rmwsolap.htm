</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>When requesting leads from Rightmove, Rightmove suggests an overlap in the export periods for which you are requesting data.  This is to minimise the loss of data due to replication lag.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call the service every 15 minutes, and always request the last 20 minutes&rsquo; worth of data.  Therefore set a polling interval of 15 minutes and an overlap of 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Call the service hourly and always request the last 70 minutes&rsquo; worth of data.  Therefore set a polling interval of 60 minutes and an overlap of 10 minutes.</li>
</ul>
