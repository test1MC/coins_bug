<span class="parameter">HSPP/BASEDIR - </span> Base directory for files
</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>The base directory on the COINS server that the brokers will use to store new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hs prospect"/> messages that are downloaded from a property portal.  By default they will use <span class="FileName">$BASE/var</span>.</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Rightmove files are stored in a subdirectory <span class="filename">Rightmove</span>.</li>
<li>Zoopla files are stored in a subdirectory <span class="FileName">Zoopla</span>.</li>
<li>Smart New Homes files are stored in a subdirectory <span class="filename">SmartNewHomes</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each portal directory (for example <span class="filename">$BASE/var/Rightmove</span>) also has an <span class="FileName">ftp </span>and <span class="filename">old </span>directory.  The <span class="filename">ftp </span>directory temporarily stores the files downloaded from the portal's FTP site.  The <span class="filename">old </span>directory is an archive for files processed into COINS; once processed they are removed from the <span class="filename">ftp </span>directory and moved to the <span class="filename">old </span>directory.  The portal directory also contains a log file (for example <span class="filename">Rightmove.log</span>) and a lock file (for example <span class="filename">Rightmove.lk</span>).  Removing the lock file will allow the COINS portal process to be terminated, for example to allow for overnight backup.</p></p>
