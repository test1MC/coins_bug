<div class="param_def">
<p>Whether to allow earlier recharage of workshop items by creating GRN value recharge transactions (<span class="userinput">Y</span> or <span class="userinput">N</span>).</p>
<p>This allows you to post estimated costs to the workshop when items from the workshop order are received. These transactions have no cost value and have no effect on the GL, but allow the recharge to happen much earlier as they do have a recharge amount. When the true cost is posted to the workshop, the recharge amount will be reduced by the estimated value. Any difference can be absorbed by zeroing the recharge amount, or recharged with the final<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is"/>ation of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc jobcard"/>.</p>
