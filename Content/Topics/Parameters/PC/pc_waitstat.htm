<div class="param_def">
<p>The status code of assets waiting for decision.</p>
<p>This status is used when the person doing first line assessment is unsure and refers the decision (whether to make the asset available or create a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc jobcard"/>) to someone else. If this is populated, a third action &#8211; Awaiting Decision &#8211; becomes available on the Maintenance Desk - Assets tab, to allow you to set the status of assets that are to be inspected after they are returned.</p>
