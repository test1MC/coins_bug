</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>Whether to include unconfirmed returns in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant"/> charge run (<span class="userinput">Y</span> or <span class="userinput">N</span>).</p>
<p>If this is set to <span class="userinput">Y</span>, unconfirmed returns are included in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant"/> charge run. The items are still seen as <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc onhire"/> until the return has been confirmed, but the charges will not generate while the return stays unconfirmed. This applies only for items charged based on the days <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc onhire"/>, weekly or daily. </p>
<p>This can reduce the number of credit notes due to charging beyond the unconfirmed return date of an asset, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.st stock"/> item or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc rehire"/>, and also means that the <span class="wrap"><span class="nw"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract"/>(s)</span>/ <span class="nw">customer(s)</span></span> will have up to date, correct costs.</p>
