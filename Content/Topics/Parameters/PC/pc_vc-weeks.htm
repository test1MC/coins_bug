<span class="parameter">PC/VC-WEEKS - </span> When Using 4WEEk Nbr of Days For Weeks
</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>This parameter allows you to change to charging a number of weeks, by specifying the day counts to round down as a list. Entry 1 is the number of days up to that count as zero weeks, and entry to the number of days that count as one week.  If set to <span style="font-family: Arial;">3,9,15,22</span> then up to 3 days is free, up to 9 days is 1 week, up to 15 days is 2 weeks, up to 22 days is 3 weeks and over is 4 weeks.</p>
<p>If not set the variable charge will work out the cheapest combination of day/week/month charges, if we round up.  So 26 days would charge the cheapest of 3 weeks 5 days, 4 weeks or 1 month.</p>
