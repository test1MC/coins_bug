        <p class="Body">When <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR caps" /> Items were shared between all <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR caps" /> Models defined in a company, it caused issues if the Items were named as per the common naming convention (e.g. CCFCAC). For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet3">Importing a new Model could overwrite an Item and break existing Models.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet3">Any changes in an Item shared by different Models affected all <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR caps" />s.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet3">Except Item value changes, Items dependency also could change and affect an entire company.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">Similar issues occurred with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR caps" /> Styles.</p>
        <p class="Body">As a result of these issues, there was a need to use a different formula for different Models in the same Company (used as per <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract caps" /> specific). This has now been accomplished by allowing <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR caps" /> Items and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR caps" /> Styles to be maintained at the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR caps" /> Model level. By using Model specific sets of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR caps" /> Items and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR caps" /> Styles, any changes made in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR caps" /> Model do not affect other Models.</p>
        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">This document describes how the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR caps" /> module has been modified to allow the use of Model specific Items and Styles.
