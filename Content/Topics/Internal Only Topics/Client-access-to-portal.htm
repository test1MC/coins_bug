        <h1>Client Access to Portal</h1>
        <p>One feature available from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA v11.08 onwards,  is it is possible to open the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Help Portal" /> directly from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. </p>
        <p>This replaces the OA documentation, so the Documentation item on the user menu will open the help on the website <b>without the user having to log in to the client area</b>.
</p>
        <p><![CDATA[
]]><img src="../../Resources/Images/Doc-Menu-Img.png" /></p>
        <p>Links from the side-frame help will also open the appropriate topic in the portal.

This has not been announced directly to the clients as the feature has not been exhaustively tested, and we wanted to get feedback on the portal generally before encouraging clients to switch. </p>
        <p>However, if individual clients want to enable this on 11.08, all they need to do is to set the SY parameter DOCBASE as follows:
</p>
        <p>&#160;</p><span class="Emphasis">
https://www.coins-global.com/resources/documentation/uk/Default.htm
</span>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">
Individual users may also need to allow popups from this URL.

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If DOCBASE is blank, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will continue to use the existing online documentation.
</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">
If any clients on 11.08 do choose to implement this, please let Don Barwick and Nigel Longley know. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Please also let us know if you have ANY feedback from clients on the new portal.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
