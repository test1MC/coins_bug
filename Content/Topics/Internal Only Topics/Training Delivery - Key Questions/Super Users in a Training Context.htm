        <h1>Super Users in a Training Context</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This section is intended define the role of a Super User in a training context so that clients can identify suitable staff members to attend <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Train the Trainer workshops.  Following this training, the Super Users will be able to roll out <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> training in their own organisations and be a single point of contact between staff in their regions and the appropriate <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> support team in their company.</p>
        <p>Without Super Users in place to field the in-house training users will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create their own ways of doing things and pass on any bad-habits to new starters</li>
            <li>Inadvertently change or impair a business process</li>
            <li>Introduce changes that may have a knock-on effect on other teams</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Definition of a Super User</h2>
        <p>Choosing the right people to be a Super User is an important part in the creation of an effective support system.  Super Users should be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recognised as Subject Matter Experts within their departments and understand the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> enabled business processes for their business unit.</li>
            <li>Someone who will be available so others can call for assistance</li>
            <li>Understand the problems that users will face using the application to carry out their roles</li>
            <li>Willing to take on the role</li>
            <li>Willing to perform system testing</li>
            <li>Be confident in guiding and training others</li>
            <li>Someone who can explain things clearly to their colleagues</li>
            <li>Someone who is prepared to attend Special Interest Groups and disseminate relevant information to the team.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a general rule, Super Users should not be Local Managers as they are often extremely busy and not always available.  In additional, users usually avoid raising their lack of skills to a boss.  Team leaders – such as Senior <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> Clerks, or Senior Buyers – are often a good choice.</p>
        <p>Super Users are the first people in a support chain.  They should be able to deal with the normal user requests dealing with the use of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, for which they should have received special training.</p>
        <p>Super Users should also have the responsibility of either giving training to new starters within their business function or able to provide other trainers with the necessary guidance to provide appropriate training to meet specific business needs.</p>
        <h2>Benefits of having Super Users</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces the training overhead</li>
            <li>Keeps messages and process consistent</li>
            <li>Ensures that business processes are maintained and understood</li>
            <li>They are still part of the workforce, so are users who understand the way the system is used.</li>
            <li>They can be agents of change within an organisation</li>
            <li>Provide a useful bridge between users and a central support team, overseeing User Acceptance Testing for new versions, features and fixes, and feeding back user issues and requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Role of a Super User in Training</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Localise training materials</li>
            <li>Support training deployment</li>
            <li>Deliver End User Training</li>
            <li>Update local documentation where appropriate</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Estimated Workload for a Super User</h2>
        <p>Commitment Required : Super Users will continue in their current positions and incorporate the role of Super User in addition to their current job.</p>
        <p>For integration testing, training and final preparation the time requirement is 50-75%</p>
        <p>In the first 1 to 3 months past go-live, the super user role usually requires a 75% commitment, diminishing over time</p>
        <p>In the BAU state after 3 months, Super Users are integrated back into the business, but still serve as primary support within their areas and log issues with the support tem</p>
        <p>If training end-users, a core group of trainers will continue through subsequent roll outs.</p>
