        <p><span class="function" title="Function:%WSY2034BSUR">Interactive Security Update</span> allows you to control what access a user or group has to functions and subfunctions (such as buttons).&#160;When you select the user or group you want to grant security for, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> opens a second window in which you can go to the page for which you want to set the permissions, and a third window in which you can set the access that the user or group has to the various functions on that screen. </p>
