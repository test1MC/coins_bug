    <h1 class="print">Batch Input</h1>
    <p>The procedure for entering batches of transactions is similar for every <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> module, so it is described here.</p>
    <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, you enter most financial transactions (such as invoices or payment certificates) in batches, even if there is only one transaction. Each batch of transactions has a batch number (which <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> generates) and a reference (which you give it), either of which you can use later to refer to the batch.</p>
    <p>The details of the transactions are held in a batch file, in the order in which you enter them, but <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> does not actually update the database until you post the batch. This means that you do not have to complete the batch immediately; you can save the work you have done so far, to complete it at a later stage, or you can change, add or delete the entries in the batch before committing them to the database.</p>
    <p>At any time until the batch is posted, you can generate a <strong>listing report</strong> showing the contents of the batch. Once the batch has been posted, you can generate a <strong>posting report</strong> (which is the audit trail for that batch). To generate either report, use the <span class="function">Posting Reports </span>procedure in the relevant module.</p>
    <p>Each batch has a status, which shows which stage the input of the batch has reached.</p>

    <p>Some batches have a status of <strong>'Incomplete'</strong>. This represents a batch that was entered using<MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/COINSplus.flsnp" /> in which the control and actual totals do not agree (for example, not all transactions have been entered).</p>
    <div class="configuration">
      <h2 class="print">Batch configuration</h2>
      <p>There is a batch configuration function in each financial module which allows you to define the standard characteristics for each type of batch transaction, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which control totals are used.</li>
        <li>Whether the batch can be forced.</li>
        <li>Whether <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> posts the batch automatically.</li>
        <li>Whether <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> generates a posting report.</li>
      </ul>
