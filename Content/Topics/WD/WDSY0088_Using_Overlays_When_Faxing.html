    <h1 class="print">Using Overlays When Faxing From COINSplus</h1>
    <p>Reports and other documents printed from <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/COINSplus.flsnp" /> often use overlays to print fixed details such as logos and headings.  These overlay files can't be passed to VSI-Fax in the same way as to a printer.  Instead, VSI-Fax uses a graphic TIFF file for the overlay.  This needs to be placed into the overlay directory on the VSI-Fax server, together with a ".dat" file to reference <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to use the correct TIFF file.</p>
    <p>There are several ares of configuration which must be completed to ensure that both <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> and VSI-Fax have the necessary information to attach the correct overlay to the fax.</p>
