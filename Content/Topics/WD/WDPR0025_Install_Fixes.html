Before using <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to submit P45 and P46 in-year returns to HMRC from 6th April 2009 onwards, you will need to ensure that the appropriate update for your release of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> has been loaded and deployed. 
<p>Releases from v10.18 and later include the updates necessary for in-year returns. </p>For releases 10.15, 10.16 and 10.17 the update was included in the 0901 patch ? if this patch has not been deployed and you are doing in-year filing for the first time, you need to install the appropriate fix from the list below:<br /><p /><p><span lang="EN-GB"><span></span></span></p><table><tbody><tr><th>Release</th><th>Fix</th></tr><tr><td>V10.17 </td><td>47010</td></tr><tr><td>V10.16 </td><td>47009</td></tr><tr><td>V10.15 </td><td>47008</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As with all new software fixes, we recommend that you install and test this in a non-live environment first.  <br /></p></body>
