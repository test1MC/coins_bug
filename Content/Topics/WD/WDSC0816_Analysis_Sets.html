        <p>The final frame in the <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC2000BSBM">Subcontractor Maintenance</span> series shows Analysis Sets if they have been defined in configuration. You can change the Analysis Set information later by selecting Analysis from the pop up menu. </p>
        <p>For each analysis set, enter the code for this subcontractor, or use drop down list to select one. </p>
        <p>If no analysis sets have been defined then this frame does not appear. </p>
