    <h1 class="print">Meetings</h1>
    <p>Using the <span class="function" title="Function:%WPT1000SPIJ">Communication Management</span> workbench, you can set up meetings, invite attendees and record who attended the meeting, set up lists of meeting items and automatically carry forward recurring items and unfinished actions to the following meeting.</p>
    <p>You can use the Meeting Types function to set up different types of meeting.  Meeting types can be set up with default items which are added to new meetings when they are created. </p>
    <p>There are three different types of meeting items:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Single items</strong>.  These are items that only relate to one meeting.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Recurring items</strong>.  These are similar but distinct items that occur at every related meeting; if a recurring item is added to a meeting?s item list, an identical item is also added to the item list of the following meeting when that is created.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Actions</strong> - things that need to be done.  These are items that are carried over from one meeting to the next until they are complete.  If an action is not marked as closed, it is added to the item list of the following meeting when that is created.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Print and/or email the meeting minutes </li>
      <li>Generate a letter relating to the meeting</li>
      <li>Create a follow-on meeting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can attach documents to a meeting, and to individual meeting actions (but not to single or recurring meeting items).<br /></p>
    <div class="process">
      <h2 class="print">To create the next meeting:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the option (or the browse action) <span class="userinput">Create Next Meeting</span>. 
<p />When you create the next meeting, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> marks the current meeting as having happened.   This restricts the changes you can make to the meeting record.  
<p />You should usually create the new meeting after you have entered all the notes about the meeting, but before you print the meeting minutes.  </li>
        <li>
          <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> works out the default date of the next meeting from the meeting frequency, but you can change the date and time.  The meeting number of the next meeting will be one more than the current meeting number. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Recurring items will be created for the new meeting, and given a number based on the new meeting number.</li>
          <li>Any open Actions will be copied to the new meeting, and will be given the same number as on the current meeting.</li>
          <li>Entries on the Attendees and Copies To tabs will be copied to the new meeting.<br /></li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
