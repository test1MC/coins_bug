            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Annual Tax Tables &amp; NI Rates</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> now stores an annual tax and NI rates table.&#160; To view the data, select the tax year you want on the left-hand side of the screen, then to maintain, press <span class="null"><span class="key">Return</span></span>.</p>
        <p>When the Year End Processing is run, it checks to see if there is an annual rates record for the new year. If not, it creates one and defaults the rates from the prior year.</p>
        <p>The parameter <span class="parameter">TAXDELAY </span>controls the date from which the new tax bands and rates should be applied.&#160;The default for this is the 6th of April, which would be entered as&#160;06/04 in the parameter.</p>
        <p><strong>Note the details below are PRE BUDGET, so the tax bands may change for 2012.</strong>
