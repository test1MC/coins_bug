    <p>Use the process of entering manual <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" /> to do any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter adjustments to previous <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" />, such as moving time from one analysis to another.</li>
      <li>Reclass deductions.</li>
      <li>Enter a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> that has been written by hand and distributed to the employee.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do not use this process to enter <strong>Voids</strong>. As a rule, manual <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" /> will not result in an increase in wages or net pay except if a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> is written by hand.</p>

      <p>Enter a manual <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> record </p>
      <ol>
        <li>In OA <span class="module">Payroll</span>, go to <span class="function" title="Function:%WP6100BPRK">Timesheet Input</span> to add a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" />.</li>
        <li>Select <span class="userinput">Manual </span>as the <span class="null"><span class="field"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Type</span></span>.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="field"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span> number other than 1 through 9 to be associated with this manual payment.</li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">
        <p>As a rule, you should designate a series of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> numbers outside your regular <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> number series for <strong>Adjustments</strong>, such as 9000-9999. The net amount of these <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" /> will be $0.00. This will help the reconciliation process in <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.cash book" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span>, as well as retain the integrity of the "real" payroll <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> numbers.</p>
        <p>If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> is for wages paid by hand, you will want to implement a numbering sequence to identify the number of the actual <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> and perhaps prefix it by the bank code.</p>

          <strong>Adjustments and Reclasses</strong>
        </p>
        <p>If you do not expect the adjusting manual <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> to result in Net Pay of $0, you may need to make the adjustments via a computer <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" />. An example of when to use a computer <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> is when you need to correct a Union.<br /><br />If the manual <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> is for an adjustment to the analysis (in and out transactions), the negative hours will require you to reference the <span class="field">Original Period</span>, <span class="field"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span>, and <span class="field">Transaction Number</span>. This transaction must match the original transaction <strong>exactly</strong>. If you intend to only move a portion of the hours, you will need to re-enter both the hours you wish to reclass <strong>and </strong>the hours you wish to keep with the original analysis.</p>
        <p>When making adjustments to pay, it is necessary to enter overrides. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> automatically reverse any deductions from pay, as well as non-cash fringes and employer paid taxes and insurance associated with the negative transaction.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you do not need the deductions or fringes in cash, delete them from overrides.</li>
          <li>If you need to move fringes in pay or deductions, be sure to enter them to a balancing fringe or deduction so the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" />'s net pay is $0.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Run calculations and then review the <strong>Net Detail</strong> and <strong>Burden Detail</strong> to ensure all of the values are zero ($0). If you need to make any corrections, run the <span class="function">Reset </span>function and enter the appropriate overrides to reduce the overall values to zero.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Manual <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> distributed by hand</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Enter the timesheet distributions associated with the manual <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" />. Enter overrides for fringes paid in cash and for deductions <strong>only</strong>. Non-cash fringes, employer paid taxes, and employer paid insurances will compute when <span class="function">Calculations </span>is run and be added to the value of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> to create the appropriate Burdened <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour" /> amount.</p>
