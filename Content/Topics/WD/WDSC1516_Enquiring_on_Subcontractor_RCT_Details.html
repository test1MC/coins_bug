        <p>Additional RCT information is available if you click the subcontract account number link in the browse (rather than clicking the&#160;<img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/open.svg" class="button" /> button).&#160; This gives the following screen:</p>

        </p>
        <p>This includes an <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquiry" /> browse on the Tax &amp; <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> tab showing the different Tax Rates which have been notified by Revenue.&#160; This is updated whenever an electronic Contract Notification or&#160;Payment Notification has a different rate than previously recorded here.</p>
        <p>Also note that there is a C2 Tax tab which displays the old C2 card details under the previous RCT scheme for reference.<br /></p>
