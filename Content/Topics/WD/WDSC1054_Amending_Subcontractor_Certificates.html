    <h1 class="print">Subcontractor Certificates - Amending Subcontractor Certificates</h1>
    <p>Until the batch has been posted, and as long as the certificate is the most recent one you have entered, you can amend any of the details. </p>
    <p>If you have entered another certificate since the one you want to amend delete the later certificate, amend the previous certificate, then re-enter the later certificate.</p>
    <p>If you have already posted the certificate, you can still amend some of the details (not the values) and change the hold status.  <br /></p>
