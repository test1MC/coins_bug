    <h1 class="print">Verifying Subcontractors</h1>
    <p>Before a contractor can make a payment to a subcontractor for construction work, they may need to verify with HMRC that the subcontractor is registered.</p>
    <p>See CIS 340 section 1.8, 3.2-3.15.</p>
    <p>There are two ways to handle the subcontractor verification process in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Offline verification</li>
      <li>Electronic verification</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can only pay a subcontractor who has been verified with HMRC (unless they are outside the scope of the scheme or covered by the transitional rules).  A subcontractor who has been verified will be either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>unmatched - in which case you must pay them at the higher rate of deduction (30%).</li>
      <li>matched - in which case their tax treatment (as advised by HMRC) tells you whether to pay them gross or at the lower rate of deduction (20%).<br /></li>
    </ul>
