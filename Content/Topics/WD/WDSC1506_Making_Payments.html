    <h1 class="print">eRCT - Making Payments</h1>
    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will not let you print <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" /> and/or remittances, or generate <MadCap:variable name="Variables.eft" /> payments, for any payments that require author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation but have not been author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed by Revenue.</p>
    <p>Note that transactions which satisfy any of the following do not require author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation by Revenue:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The subcontractor has a tax scheme of Exempt.</li>
      <li>The subcontract is shown as not RCT-able.</li>
      <li>The taxable amount is negative.  You cannot get author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation for a negative item, so you may need to adjust the RCT Return to offset the negative certificate against positive certificates for the same subcontractor.</li>
      <li>Internal transfers with a positive payment certificate on one contract and an equal negative payment certificate on another.  In this case the total value of the payment is zero, so there is nothing to include on the Return.</li>
    </ul>
