        <p>Within <span class="function" title="Function:%WHRBPOR">Personnel Workbench</span>, <span class="function" title="Function:%WHRBPQT">Annual Leave</span> allows you to record the employee's annual leave. Annual leave includes any time taken off by the employee where that time is paid for by the employer.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images_G-I/HR/HR_000301.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>The Annual Leave tab shows the <span class="field">Status</span> of any <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday" /> requests, and you can update the dates on existing <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holidays" />. You can update any of the main <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday" /> details, but for a booked <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday" /> you will only be able to view any amendment details.</p>
        <p>You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Approve new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday" /> requests by filling in the <span class="field 1">Author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed By</span> field.</li>
            <li>Approve cancellation requests by deleting the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday" />.</li>
            <li>Approve amendment requests by altering the main <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday" /> record to match the request.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of these will cause <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to send out notification emails. If you click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/del.svg" class="button" /> the record will always be deleted (that is, this will not simply cancel a cancellation or amendment request).</p>
