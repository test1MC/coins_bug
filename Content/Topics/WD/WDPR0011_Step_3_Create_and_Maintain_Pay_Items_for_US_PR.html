    <p>Before using the <span class="module">Payroll</span> module, there are a number of steps that should be performed initially to set it up in effective working order. Step 3 is outlined below.</p>
    <p>After you have performed these initial steps, you are ready to process Payroll (see <a href="WDPR0004_Processing_Payroll.html">Processing Payroll</a>).</p>

      <h2 class="print">How to create/maintain pay items to be used for US Payroll:</h2>
      <p>Use <span class="function" title="Function:%WPR210BQRI">Pay Items</span> to create and maintain pay items used in various file maintenances. Pay items are used to hold Gross Pay, Net Pay, computed values used in <span class="null"><span class="module">Payroll, </span></span>such as Withholding, as well as to create a user-determined Gross Pay Amount used for other computations.<span> P</span>ay items used must be included in any sequence associated with a Payroll run, which is set up in <span class="function" title="Function:%WPR240BPSQ">Item Sequences</span>.</p>

      <p class="note" dir="ltr">Pay items used in US <span class="module">Payroll </span>can only have a type of <span class="screentype">Subtotal</span> or <span class="screentype">Hours</span>.</p>
      <p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px;">When used in US <span class="module">Payroll</span>, Pay Item Effects are currently limited to Add and Subtract only. Since pay items are shared among all <span class="module">Payroll </span><MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" />, you must give careful consideration to the setup and maintenance of pay items. Changes can produce unwanted effects. Additionally, if pay items are added, you need to review sequences to see if they need to be modified to include new pay items.</p>
