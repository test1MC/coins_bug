    <h1 class="print">Cost Invoices</h1>
    <p>If you did not cost the invoice(s) at the time of invoice entry, you can cost them at a later time. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> allows you to cost multiple invoices for various <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" /> at the same time. Every group (batch) of invoices that you cost at any one time will be automatically allocated a costing batch reference number by <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. </p>
    <div class="process">
      <h2 class="print">To confirm the costing analysis for a "Registered" or a "Provisionally" costed invoice:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to Input - <span class="function" title="Function:%WPL1070BCOB">Cost Invoices</span></li>
        <li>Enter a new costing batch.
<p class="noteheader">NOTE</p><div class="note">If you delete a costing batch, any transactions that were costed in the deleted batch will remain on the register and will have to be costed again in another batch. </div></li>
        <li>Specify the invoice you want to cost. Either:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" /> code in the <span class="field"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Account </span>field, and then enter the internal reference number of the invoice in the <span class="field">Internal Reference </span>field.</li>
          <li>Leave the <span class="field"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Account </span>field blank and enter the reference number in the <span class="field">Internal Reference </span>field. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays the Costing Distribution tab.
<p class="noteheader">NOTE</p><div class="note">The <span class="field">Internal Reference </span>lookup list includes only those transactions that have not yet been paid. Also shown is the distribution type (Registered, Costed or Provisional) so that you can easily identify and select the transaction(s) that still need costing. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will not allow you to select a transaction if it has already been costed. </div></li>
        </ul>
        <li>To cost the invoice, enter a new costing record (see <a href="WDPL0213_Distributing_Invoice_Costs.html">Distributing Invoice Costs</a>).</li>
        <li>When you have finished costing invoices, you need to post the batch.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once the batch has been posted, the costed transactions can be selected for payment. (See <a href="WDPL0411_Selecting_Invoices_for_Payment.html">Selecting Invoices for Payment</a>).</p>
