        <h1 class="print">Final Submission for the Year</h1>
        <p>When you make the final submission for a tax year (or the final submission because a PAYE scheme has ceased), there are additional declarations you must make.&#160; This must be done from the global <span class="function" title="Function:%WPR730BSTE">HMRC Workbench</span>, because the declarations cover all employees, regardless of their pay frequency.</p>
        <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
        <div class="note">
            <ol>
                <li>If a submission that is marked as a final submission has been made, and you make a further submission in the same tax year on one of the frequency-specific workbenches, the "Final Submission" answers are shown on a separate tab.</li>
                <li>If you have submitted your final FPS (and where appropriate an EPS) for the tax year, but haven't indicated that this is your 'Final submission for the tax year', you must submit an EPS indicating that it is your 'Final submission for the tax year'. You must also complete the end-of year-declarations and questions.&#160;</li>
            </ol>
