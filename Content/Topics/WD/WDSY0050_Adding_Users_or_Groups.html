    <h1 class="print">Adding a New User or Group to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></h1>
    <p>Before you add a new user to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, you need to decide which group (or groups) they will belong to. If an appropriate group does not exist, you need to add a new group. Use <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBSUR1">Groups</span>.</p>
    <p>You may want to decide beforehand on a convention for user and group IDs. For example, initial and first seven letters of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.last name" />, or first three letters of forename plus first three letters of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.last name" />. Remember that user and group IDs must be unique. </p>
    <p>To add a new user, use <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBSUR">Users</span>. </p>
    <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
    <p class="note">Any changes you make to an existing user record using <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBSUR">Users</span> will only take effect the next time the user logs in, so if the user is already logged in, you may want to ask them to log out before you make changes. You can find out if a user is logged in using the <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBSYL">Current Users</span><MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquiry" />.</p>
    <p>When you have added the user record, you may also need to do one or more of the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set up the user view (see <a href="WDCI5002_User_View_Set_Up.html">User View Set Up</a>). </li>
      <li>Set up <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> security for the user (see <a href="WDSY0006_Account_and_Contract_Security.html">Account and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Security</a>). </li>
      <li>If they are a buyer, set them up as a buyer in the Procurement system (see Buyers in the Procurement Set-Up Guide). </li>
      <li>If you are using the timesheet system, set them up as an employee (see Setting up employees and rates in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Status Guide). </li>
    </ul>
