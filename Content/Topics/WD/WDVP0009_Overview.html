    <h1 class="print">VAP Overview</h1>
    <p>VAP stands for Valuations and Automated Payments.  VAP is concerned with recording the progress of work done on a house-building site and paying subcontractors for the work done.</p>
    <p>The main business processes that VAP supports are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recording the progress of work on site.  Surveyors can record in detail the progress of work against the construction <MadCap:variable name="Variables.programme" />. A number of industry-standard valuation and approval methods are available, which ensure that all surveyors work to a consistent process.</li>
      <li>Controlling payments.  Work on individual plots can be measured against pre-defined build stages, and payments authorised accordingly.   This helps ensure that subcontractors are paid correctly for the work they have done and avoids duplicated payments.</li>
      <li>Recording materials on site.  This provides a true picture of the value of the site, and feeds into the {cv cvr}.</li>
      <li>Calculating accruals.  If subcontract work has been valued but not certified, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> calculates an accrual figure; this can be fed into the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cv cvr" />.</li>
      <li>Handling of dayworks and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.sv variations" />.<br /></li>
    </ul>
