    <h1 class="print">Recording and Making Payments</h1>
    <p>The procedure for processing subcontractor payments in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is not significantly affected by the changes to the CIS scheme.  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> holds the two different rates of tax deduction in parameters, and applies them as appropriate dependent on the status of the subcontractor as recorded in subcontractor verification.  </p>
    <p>You can make payments either through subcontractor certificates or through <MadCap:variable name="Variables.purchase ledger" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> invoices with a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour" /> element.  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> checks that the last payment date is within the past two tax years, and checks the verification status, to make sure that the subcontractor can be paid.  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> then calculates any necessary deduction according to the tax treatment of the subcontractor.<br /></p>
