        <h2>Record Build Progress – Progress Tick Sheet</h2>
        <p>The Progress Tick Sheet provides&#160;a quick method of updating the&#160;actual construction progress.&#160; It will allow quick update of plots and stages which have been completed on the same date.</p>
        <p>The layout is designed to be&#160;in a format which matches the House Sales &gt; Plot Sales &gt; Reports &gt; Construction Progress Tick Sheet report which can be sent to site for update.</p>
        <p>This screen excludes plots for which all applicable stages have been ticked, and plots which have not had any Build Release and which have not had any stages ticked.</p>
        <p>Select the Progress Tick Sheet Tab. </p>
        <p>

        <p>The plots are sorted as follows:</p>

            <li>Primary Sort: Build Sequence</li>
            <li>Within that sort by Plot Group</li>
            <li>Within that sort by Plot Number</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Plots for which all applicable stages have been <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed are excluded.&#160; Also, plots which have not had any Build Release and which have not had any stages <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed are excluded.</p>
        <p>The first three columns show the build sequence number for the plot, the plot group code and the plot number.&#160; The remaining columns represent all construction stages which are applicable to the&#160;<MadCap:variable name="Variables.vp site" />.</p>
