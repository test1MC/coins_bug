        <h1 class="print">Managing Verification Submissions</h1>
        <p>You can use <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC9030BCOI"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.cis" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Verification Submissions</span> to manage the submissions.&#160; If everything is working normally, you should not need to use this function.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>You can:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>View the status of a submission.&#160; This is shown on the main screen.</li>
            <li>View the details of a submission.&#160; Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/detail.svg" class="button" />.</li>
            <li>Submit a request.&#160; You should not normally need to use this, but if there is a fatal error with the submission or a problem that corrupts the data, you might want to re-submit the request after the problem has been sorted out.&#160; Submit starts from the beginning, whereas Restart picks up from the most recent event.
<p>&#160;</p>
Select the request and choose Submit from the Choose Action menu.</li>
            <li>Restart a request.&#160; If the submission times out (that is, if <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> does not receive a response from the Government Gateway after a specified number of requests), the status will be set to "Timeout".&#160; In this case <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will automatically create a delayed background entry, which will run a restart after a specified number of minutes. However you can delete this so you can restart manually.&#160; As soon as you choose Restart, the status changes to "Restarted".&#160; If you try to restart and the status is not correct you will get an error (so <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will not let you restart twice by mistake).
<p>&#160;</p>
Select the request and choose Restart from the Choose Action menu.</li>
            <li>Output the XML file without submitting it to HMRC.&#160; This may be useful for testing.
<p>The file will be in the IR-CIS-VERIFY directory below the base directory specified by the <span class="parameter">SCUK/EGOVRDIR </span>parameter, and will have a name of the form &lt;attempt ID&gt;pst1.xml.</p>
Select the request and choose Output XML from the Choose Action menu.&#160;</li>
            <li>Load an XML file as if it were a response from HMRC.&#160; This may be useful for testing.
<p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will look for a file with a name of the form &lt;attempt-ID&gt;get1.xml in the IR-CIS-VERIFY directory below the base directory specified by the <span class="parameter">SCUK/EGOVRDIR </span>parameter</p>
Select the request and choose Load XML from the Choose Action menu.&#160;</li>
