    <h1 class="print">Permissions</h1>
    <p>You may find that other people using <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> have menus that are different from yours. You may also find that procedures or functions described in the manuals are not available to you. </p>
    <p>This is because <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> uses menus to control which procedures you are allowed to use. If an option does not appear on your menu, you do not have the permissions to use it. </p>
    <p>For example, in <span class="module">General Ledger</span>, the System Administrator may be the only user allowed to use the Administration and Setup functions, so these options would not appear on other users' menus. </p>
    <p>Your System Administrator can change the options that are available to you, and can set up new menus to suit your work needs. <br /></p>
