    <h1 class="print">Selecting Certificates for Payment</h1>
    <p>There are two ways to select certificates:  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Selecting <strong>manually</strong> means that you can choose to pay individual certificates and can pay certificates that are on hold. </li>
      <li>Selecting<strong> in batches</strong> means that you can select all certificates that are due for payment and that meet the selection criteria you specify, provided they are not on hold. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can combine manual and batch selection: for example, you can select a group of certificates using batch selection, and then deselect individual certificates manually to stop them being paid. </p>
    <p>Selecting certificates by batch allows you to select for payment several certificates across either all or selected subcontractors. For example, you could run the function once to select all certificates, then run it again to deselect certain groups of certificates. </p>
    <p>Batch selection will not select a certificate for payment if there are any restrictions (for example, if the subcontractor is not verified with HMRC). </p>
    <p>The <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC3110RCUR">Certificates Selected/Not Selected Report</span> report allows you to report either on selected certificates or on unpaid certificates, and shows whether certificates were selected manually or by batch. If certificates are on hold, the report shows the hold codes. The report also includes an aged analysis of the payment run. <br /></p>
    <p>Certificates selected for payment are held in a payment batch. Once you have completed selection you freeze the payment batch which ensures that no further certificates can be selected for payment until the batch has been posted.  <br /></p>

      <p>To make it easier for users to identify the correct certificates during payment selection, you can configure different columns to display on the SC manual payment selection screen.  In <span class="function" title="Function:%WSY2730BSTE">Page Field Sets</span>, using the function %WSC1110BSPY, add a field set, selecting appropriate columns to display on the manual payment selection screen. <br /></p>
