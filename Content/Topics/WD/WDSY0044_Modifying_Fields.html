        <h1 class="print">Report Writer - Modifying Fields</h1>
        <p>When you choose the fields to show on your report, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> gives each field a column label and a column width, and by default will show totals for decimal fields. If you want, you can change the column labels or widths, and whether the column is totalled. You can also add fields, and change the order they appear in. </p>
        <p>Use the Fields tab to modify the report fields. </p>

        <h2>Other Field Options</h2>
        <p><span class="field">Variable </span>- If the field is required to be used in a calculation, a variable can be assigned.</p>
        <p><span class="field">Label</span> - The Name which will appear on the top of each column on the report.</p>
        <p><span class="field">Width</span> - <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Report Writer will create default column widths, these can be overridden as required by entering a value (in mm). (Note that the fields should not exceed the number of mm assigned in the page layout, that is, Standard A4 Landscape Report Layout is 297mm).</p>
        <p><span class="field">Total</span> - If you require the field to be totalled at the end of each column, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the box. In conjunction with this field, you can select from the Total Types as to which type of Total you want to see. </p>
        <p>Available Options are the Maximum, Minimum, Average, Distinct Values or you can count the number of records by using the Count Option - By default all totals will Add.</p>
        <p><span class="field">Hidden</span> - You can now hide a field, so if you require the information from a field (for example, to be used in a calculation) but you do not necessarily want this field to appear on the report, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> this box.</p>
        <p><span class="field">X &amp; Y</span> - These two fields are the axes for the graph.</p>
        <p><span class="field">Calculations </span>- You can now put complex or simple calculations into fields. Example of a simple calculation would be after assigning two fields to variables a and b - a third field can be added displaying the sum of these two fields by entering a + b into the calculation field.</p>
        <p>For further information on Calculations, please refer to documentation on using Calculations.</p>
        <p><span class="field">Format </span>- The format of a field will take on the default format as seen in the Database <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquiry" style="text-transform: capitalize;" />; however, if you use a calculation, a format will have to be defined on the field if the information is required to be standard<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed on the report. Some example formats are:</p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>-&gt;&gt;&gt;,&gt;&gt;&gt;,&gt;&gt;9</td>
                    <td>to display monetary values without pence</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>(&gt;&gt;&gt;,&gt;&gt;&gt;,&gt;&gt;9.99) </td>
                    <td>to display negatives with parentheses </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>-&gt;&gt;9.99%</td>
                    <td>to display values as percentages</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>&#160;&#160; 
<div class="note">TIP : Always ensure your formats allow for negative values.</div><p>After all the fields within the field tab are defined, click the <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/save.svg" class="button" /> [Save] button.</p></body>
