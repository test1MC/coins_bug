        <p>Draft Certificate Processing provides an author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation process for subcontract certificates prior to them being posted to the ledger. Certificates can be entered and author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed by different individuals, and author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation can be carried out in two stages (that is, by two different individuals) if required. Once draft certificates have been author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed, they can be included in a batch and posted to the ledgers in the standard <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> way. </p>
        <p>A draft certificate passes through different author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation levels: </p>
        <p>0 = Attention required. At this level certificates can be amended. They can be put on commercial hold. They can also be released (set to level 1). </p>
        <p>1 = Released/Awaiting Level 2 author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation. They can be recalled (set back to level 0). </p>
        <p>2 = Awaiting level 3 author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation. </p>
        <p>3 = Awaiting batch creation. </p>
        <p>For low-value transactions, you can allow a lower level of author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation.&#160; You can set the default value below which this applies, and can also define the values on a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />-by-<MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> basis.</p>
