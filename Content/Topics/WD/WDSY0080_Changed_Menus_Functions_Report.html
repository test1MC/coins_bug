      <span class="function" title="Function:%MS301">Changed Function/Menu Report</span> (currently in <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/coinsplus.flsnp" /> only) lists all standard menus and functions that have been changed since the last upgrade. It should be used at each upgrade to ensure that no changes have been applied, or if they have, to replicate these changes using the standard methods outlined above so that the user does not lose any functionality as a result of the upgrade. </p>
