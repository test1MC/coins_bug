    <h1 class="print">Employer Alignment Submission</h1>
    <p>HMRC will issue each employer with a date per PAYE scheme from which they should start doing RTI submissions. On or after this date most employers will need to make an Employer Alignment Submission (EAS) for the PAYE scheme. The EAS is a one-off submission for the PAYE scheme, which will include all employees employed in the current tax year (including leavers, and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr starter" />s who have not yet been paid but have had an In Year Movements <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr starter" /> form sent already).</p>
    <p>It will only be possible to create one live EAS per PAYE scheme and only when no live RTI submissions have yet been made for that PAYE scheme.</p>
    <p>The HMRC requirement to do an initial alignment submission is only for the transition period from the old PAYE returns to RTI and will not apply after October 2013 at all. Until the end of November 2013 <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will require there to be an EAS (or first FPS - see <a href="WDPR0110_First_FPS.html">First FPS</a>) before enabling the other RTI features, to allow a little slack for teething problems getting a first submission sent out. From December 2013 EAS submissions will not be allowed at all.</p>
