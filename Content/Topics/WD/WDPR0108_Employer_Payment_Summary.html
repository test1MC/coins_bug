    <h1 class="print">Employer Payment Summary</h1>
    <p>You need to submit an Employer Payment Summary (EPS) when you want to recover:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>statutory payments,</li>
      <li>NICs compensation on statutory payments,</li>
      <li>Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) deductions suffered, or</li>
      <li>an amount under the Regional National Insurance Contributions Holiday for New Businesses (NICs Holiday).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should also submit an EPS when no payments are made to any employees in the PAYE scheme in the tax month.  In this case you do not also need to submit an FPS.</p>
    <p>This is a global submission covering all <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" /> and pay frequencies which use the PAYE scheme.</p>
