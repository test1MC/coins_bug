        <h1 class="print">Unmatched Subcontractor Registers with HMRC</h1>
        <p>If an unregistered subcontractor registers with HMRC, they will receive from HRMC a CIS 313.&#160; When the subcontractor informs you that they are registered, create a new verification record for the subcontractor, and enter the Verification Status as New; then submit that record for verification in the normal way.</p>
        <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
        <div class="note">It may be helpful for you to request a copy of the CIS 313 from the subcontractor, to ensure that you have the details exactly as registered with HMRC.</div>
