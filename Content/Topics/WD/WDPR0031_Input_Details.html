    <h1 class="print">Details Which Need To Be Directly Input to Forms</h1>
    <p>Details of the previous employment for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr starter" />s on form P45(3) will always need to be input on the form as these are not recorded elsewhere on <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Payroll (except the previous cumulative pay and tax figures).</p>
    <p>Details of which statement has been <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed by the employee on form P46 (A, B, C or none) will always need to be input on the form.</p>
    <p>For <MadCap:variable name="Variables.leaver employee" />s, all details on form P45(1) can be completed from normal <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> payroll processing; it should not be necessary to input any details directly on the form. <br /></p>
