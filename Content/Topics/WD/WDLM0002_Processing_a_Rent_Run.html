        <h1 class="print">Processing a Rent Run</h1>
        <p><span class="function" title="Function:%WLM3070RVWB">Process Rent Run</span> has two functions. Firstly it generates the tenant rent debit note based on the details held on the tenancy record. </p>
        <p>Secondly it will generate a landlord credit rent note. A landlord rent transaction is generated once the tenant cash has been received and allocated to a tenant rent transaction. For landlords this will also create the management fee and tax deduction transactions. </p>
        <p>For properties under the guaranteed rent scheme, it is the internal landlord that gets credited/debited as the actual landlord receives cash from the company offering the guaranteed rent. For these properties the management fee is always deducted regardless of whether there is a tenancy or not.</p>
