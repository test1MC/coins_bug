        <h2>Text styles</h2>
        <p>You can choose the text style (for example: typeface, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.colour" />, border&#160;and size) for the whole report using the <span class="field">Class </span>field on the Configuration tab.&#160; You can also apply different styles to lines or columns on the report using the <span class="field">Class </span>field on the row or column.&#160; For each class, you can also select one of the pre-defined variants; for example, a Subtotal variant might be underlined, and a Total variant might be bold and underlined.&#160; Classes and variants are set up using <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBRCL">Report Class</span> in the System module.</p>
        <p>You can also use <a href="WDSY0505_FOP_Formatting_Instructions.html">additional formatting</a> on individual rows or columns.</p>
        <h2>Character formatting</h2>
        <p>You can apply <a href="WDSY0117_Porgress_display_formats.html">standard Progress formatting</a> to a column on the report to control, for example, the width of the column or how numbers are displayed.&#160; Enter the format in the <span class="field">Format </span>field on the column.</p>
        <h2>Underlining</h2>
        <p><a href="../GL/GL Reporter/Standard Text Line.htm">Standard text lines</a> allow you to insert underlining etc. into the report.&#160; This technique is really confined to GL reports that are run in <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/COINSplus.flsnp" /> because all text uses fixed pitch fonts. This is not generally the case with OA PDF output.</p>
        <p>First, on the Report Rows tab add the standard text lines into the report, at the point in the structure where you wish them to appear.</p>
        <p>Then on the Report Columns tab, input what you would like to be displayed on a standard text line. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will then display these items at every occurrence of a Standard Text Line on the Report Rows tab.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Note that you can use differing effects with Standard Text Lines by using different 'Levels' in the report. For example, in the example above, you could put single underlines on level 1 (and therefore 'show on' s1) and double underlines on level 2 (and therefore 'show on' s2).</p>
