            <h1 class="print">Manually override <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> codes on certain transactions</h1>
            <p>It may be necessary to manually override the default <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code on certain transactions following the rate change. Particular attention should be paid to subcontract certificates and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales" /> transactions as detailed below.</p>
            <p>(For Ireland?)&#160;Since most construction operations are not <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> standard rated, it is anticipated that most Subcontract Ledger and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales" /> Ledger transactions will be unaffected. However, clients should consider whether there could be any unpaid standard rated transactions in either ledger and take appropriate action as explained below.</p>
            <h2>Subcontract Certificate Processing</h2>
            <p>Note that if a default <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code is set on the subcontract record, each subcontract certificate will default to that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code (although this can be overridden by the user). Thus changing the default on the subcontract records using the utility (see <a href="WDVT5007_Change_Default_VAT_Codes.html">Change Default <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Codes</a>) will ensure that future certificates will default to the new rate.</p>
            <p>However, if there is no default set on the subcontract record, each subcontract certificate will default to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code on the previous certificate for that subcontract. In this case, users will need to override the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code on the first certificate for each subcontract after the rate change.</p>
            <p>We believe that most <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> clients set a default <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code on every subcontract record so the default <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code update utility should be effective in ensuring that future transactions are at the new rate. However, users should be advised to take extra care in checking transactions following the rate change.</p>
            <h2><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales" /> Certificate Processing</h2>
            <p>The processing of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales" /> transactions is consistent with Subcontract Ledger transactions (see above) as follows. If a default <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code is set on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales" /> series, each <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales" /> transaction will default to that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code (although this can be overridden by the user). Thus changing the default on the series records using the utility (see <a href="WDVT5007_Change_Default_VAT_Codes.html">Change Default <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Codes</a>) will ensure that future transactions will default to the new rate.</p>
            <p>However, if there is no default set on the series record, each transaction will default to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code on the previous transaction for that series. In this case, users will need to override the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code on the first transaction for each series after the rate change.</p>
            <p>We believe that many <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> clients do not set a default <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code on every subcontract record so the default <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code update utility may not be effective in ensuring that future transactions are at the new rate. Therefore clients would be advised to put procedures in place for checking the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> coding of these transactions before the batches are posted.</p>
            <p>If you are using separate <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> codes for Sales and Purchases (as has become common practice on newer implementations) then you can retire the old <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code for sales to prevent errors once you have finished invoicing at the old rate (it can then be un-retired temporarily if you need to post a few transactions with the old rate). However, if you are using the same <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> codes for both Sales and Purchases you will not be able to retire the old <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code while you are still processing purchase invoices dated before the rate change.</p>
