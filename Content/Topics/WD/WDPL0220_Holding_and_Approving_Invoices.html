            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Holding and Approving Invoices</h1>
        <h2>During invoice entry</h2>
        <p>When you are entering an invoice, you have the option of putting the invoice on hold. This allows you to prevent payment of the invoice. You might want to put an invoice on hold, for example, if certain details that are required before the invoice can be processed further are missing, or the wrong items were delivered. You can also enter a code that represents the reason for placing the invoice on hold.&#160; The codes and their meanings are set up for your company; for example, "02" might mean 'All the goods have not been received'.</p>
        <p>There are two types of Invoice Hold Codes; "Commercial" and "Financial" . Depending on your company's organ<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ational structure, the hold codes might be controlled by two different individuals or departments who have the authority to decide whether transactions are put on hold or taken off hold.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Commercial (default) Hold Code - for use by the Commercial Department, for example, when a delivery has been delayed and the transaction should not be processed until full delivery of the goods has been made; or the goods were damaged and transactions should not be processed until the goods are replaced.</li>
            <li>Financial Hold Code - for use by the Finance Department, for example; when the transaction is not to be paid before a certain date; or the Finance Department are awaiting receipt of due credit before the next payment is made.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Until the <span class="field">Invoice on Hold </span>field is set to <span class="userinput">N</span>, the relevant <span class="nw">transaction(s)</span> cannot be processed further.</p>
        <h2>After posting</h2>
        <p>After an invoice has been posted, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> gives you the option of putting the invoice on hold to prevent payment, or approve a held invoice so that it can be paid.</p>
        <p>There are various different methods available that allow you to amend the hold status of invoices.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can use <span class="function" title="Function:%WPL1040BAIN">Amend Posted Invoices</span> to change the hold status of an individual invoice.</li>
            <li>The <MadCap:expanding><MadCap:expandingHead>Approve Invoices functions</MadCap:expandingHead><MadCap:expandingBody>(<span class="function" title="Function:%WPL1190BAIN">Approve Invoices by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span>, <span class="function" title="Function:%WPL1210BAIN">Approve Invoices by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /></span>, <span class="function" title="Function:%WPL1200BAIN">Approve Invoices by Entry Batch</span>, <span class="function" title="Function:%WPL1220BAIN">Approve Invoices by Costing Batch</span>)</MadCap:expandingBody></MadCap:expanding> show a list of invoices (sorted in different ways).
