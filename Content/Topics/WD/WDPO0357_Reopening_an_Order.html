    <h1 class="print">Reopening an Order</h1>
    <p>If you have closed an order (that is, matched invoices to it) and then need to enter more goods against that order (for example, you received fewer goods than you ordered but closed the order anyway, then received the remaining goods), you can re-open the order. </p>
    <div class="process">
      <h2 class="print">To reopen an order:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to the order entry screen. </li>
        <li>Select the order to be reopened. </li>
        <li>From the Choose Action list, choose <span class="userselect">Re-open Purchase Orders</span>. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can now enter further goods received against this order. </p>
