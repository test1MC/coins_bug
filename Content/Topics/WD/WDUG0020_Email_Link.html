    <h1 class="print">Email Link</h1>
    <p>The Email Link is for emailing the link of a web page you are in to someone else (the receiver must have a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> username and password on the same <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> system). This is useful for situations in which you want to show how something in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> works or if you just wanted to show someone how something looks.</p>
    <p>To do this, move the mouse pointer over your profile picture, and in the User Menu click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/mail.svg" class="button" />. This opens an email message containing the link, which you can send to the appropriate person. When the receiver clicks on the link and logs into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> when prompted, the exact web page you were in opens up.</p>
