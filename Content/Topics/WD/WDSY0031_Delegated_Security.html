    <h1 class="print">Delegated Security</h1>
    <p>You can delegate to other users (for example, regional or departmental administrators) the setting up of users, and the granting of security and access permissions. </p>
    <p>Those users will then be able to maintain the user records and function access security for any of the users they 'own', but will only be able to grant access if they themselves already have access.</p>
    <p>If you are using delegated security there is an additional filter on the <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBSUR">Users</span> browse to allow you to filter by the <span class="field">Maintained By </span>field. This will allow you to identify a block of users that are managed by an individual.</p>
    <div class="configuration">
      <h2 class="print">Delegated security - configuration</h2>
      <p>If you are using delegated security, enter the user ID of the owner against each user they are responsible for, using the <span class="field">Maintained By </span>field on each user record</p>
