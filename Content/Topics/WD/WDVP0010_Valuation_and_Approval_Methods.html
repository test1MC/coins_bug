    <h1 class="print">Valuation and Approval Methods</h1>
    <p> </p>
    <p>VAP extends the usage of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /><span class="module">Subcontract Ledger </span>to allow the build up of the gross payment amounts to be handled in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> rather than on separate spread sheets using methods familiar to house builders and developers.  Typically these are based in some way on a stage basis so that controls exist to match work applied for with work delivered on site.</p>
    <p>The main valuation and approval methods available in VAP are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>White card.</li>
      <li>Green card.</li>
      <li>Plot-based approval.</li>
      <li>Subcontract invoice registration.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>White Card / Subcontract Matrix Approval</h2>
    <p>A 'matrix' schedule of plots and stages is produced which provides a 'pro-forma' for application or invoice. The matrix schedule is issued to the subcontractor and work can be ticked off and applied for in progress stages. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can optionally link this to the ticksheet valuation for a further level of control.  The process can automatically generate subcontract accruals if a plot/stage has been valued but that element of work has not been certified for payment.</p>
    <h2>Green Card</h2>
    <p>Similar to the White Card, a matrix schedule of plots and stages is produced.  However, each 'cell' of the schedule is uniquely referenced with a Green Card. The card has a unique number which allows the fast keying or scanning of Green Cards for approval.  Green Cards are issued to either the subcontractor or site manager before works begin.  As individual stages are completed the Green Cards are presented for approval.  Entry of the unique Green Card number into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> facilitates the validation of the Subcontractor payment and the costing of the particular plot/stage.</p>
    <h2>Payment Ticksheet</h2>
    <p>The Payment Ticksheet allows fast entry and approval of stages for subcontractor payment.  Stages for approval can be presented by plot and/or by trade so that multiple plots and stages can be approved very quickly.   This method is particularly useful in conjunction with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> self-billing where the house builder produces the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> documentation without the need to receive a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> invoice from the subcontractor.</p>
    <h2>Valuation Ticksheet</h2>
    <p>Ticksheet Valuations (on-site recording of works done) can be used to generate subcontractor certificates and approvals automatically.  Effectively in this process, the valuation on works done acts like a 'goods received note' for the subcontract works.  This method is particularly useful in conjunction with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> self billing where the house builder produces the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> documentation without the need to receive a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> invoice from the subcontractor.</p>
    <h2>Multi-Order Trades</h2>
    <p>In some areas of the UK, it is common practice to employ <MadCap:variable name="Variables.gangs" /> of subcontract tradesmen, and for there to be multiple <MadCap:variable name="Variables.gangs" /> of the same trade, working on the same development at the same time.  This may apply for example to bricklayers or joiners.</p>
    <p>Multi-order trades allow you to control payments for subcontractors where the actual plots and stages which each will work on is not fixed in advance.  Each subcontractor has order values set up for all potential plots and stages which they might work on and <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> applies controls to ensure that work paid for to one subcontractor is not paid again to another.  See also <a href="WDVP0003_Multi-Order_Trades.html">Multi-Order Trades</a>.<br /></p>
