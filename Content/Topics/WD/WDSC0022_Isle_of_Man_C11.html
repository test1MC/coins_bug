    <p>The SCC11 (see also <a href="WDSC0023_Isle_of_Man_C11A.html">Isle of Man C11A</a>) is an Isle of Man (only) tax document.  It can be used to produce a substitute C11 form (i.e. a substitute if that is agreed by the specific contractor with the Isle of Man authorities).</p>
    <p>The C11 is a <strong>Certificate of Tax Deducted in Respect of Subcontract Work</strong>.  One is produced for each subcontractor from whom tax is deducted.</p>
