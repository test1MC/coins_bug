    <h1 class="print">Searching</h1>
    <p>There are various ways to find information in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.marketing" style="text-transform: capitalize;" />:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="function" title="Function:%WMK1800FMKC">
          <MadCap:variable name="Variables.marketing" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Search</span> is a quick way to search for companies, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk projects" /> or contacts, by entering all or part of their name. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays any records whose name <em>contains</em> the word you enter.</li>
      <li>
        <span class="function" title="Function:%WMK1600HMKC">My <MadCap:variable name="Variables.marketing" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span> shows you lists of the companies, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk projects" />, contacts or events you are interested in; you can filter the lists.</li>
      <li>Each of the workbenches has a main tab that is sorted alphabetically by name, plus other tabs that are sorted according to different fields. You can filter the lists according to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk workgroups" /> and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk worksubgroups" /> the records belong to, and various other fields.
<p class="noteheader">NOTE</p><div class="note">The simple filter on the workbenches looks for names or descriptions that <em>begin with</em> the text you enter, whereas <span class="function" title="Function:%WMK1800FMKC"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.marketing" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Search</span> looks for names that <em>contain</em> the text you enter.</div></li>
      <li>When you are looking at the details of a record, you can follow links to other related records. For example, when you are looking at a contact record, you can see the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk projects" /> that contact has worked on, and click a link to open the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk project" /> details. From the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk project" /> details you can see the companies that were associated with the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk project" />, and click a link to open the company details.</li>
    </ul>
