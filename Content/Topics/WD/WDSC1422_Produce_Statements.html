    <h1 class="print">Produce Statements</h1>
    <p>Contractors must provide any subcontractor from whom tax has been deducted with documentary evidence of that deduction.  This can either be in the form of a monthly Statement of Payment and Deduction (sometimes called simply payment statement or deduction statement), or on a 'per-payment' basis as part of the information supplied on the remittance advice or certificate.</p>
    <p>The documentary evidence must be issued no later than 14 days after the end of the tax month in which the payment is made.  There is no prescribed format for the statements, but they must include a set list of information.</p>
    <p>There is no obligation to issue a payment statement where the payment has been made gross; however, HMRC state that it is "good practice" to do so.</p>
    <p>See sections 3.24 - 3.26 and Appendix E of CIS 340.</p>
    <p>There are two different methods within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> for handling the Statements of Deduction process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Per-payment statements</li>
      <li>Monthly statements</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
    <div class="note">We recommend you do not mix monthly and per-payment statements.  If you do, it will be difficult to track who has received statements and who hasn't.</div>
    <p>For any one payment, you can only send one original statement of deduction (whether per-payment or monthly).  If for any reason you need to send a duplicate statement, it must be clearly marked as a duplicate.</p>
