    <p>This document will be of interest to all employers operating a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> UK payroll who will be doing their Payroll Year-end submissions electronically.</p>
    <p>Starting with returns for the 2009/2010 tax year, all employers (subject to some minor exceptions which would not apply to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> clients) are compelled to complete their Payroll year-end submissions electronically.  Previously this only applied to employers with more than 50 employees in a single tax scheme.</p>
    <p>Typing the figures in on the HMRC website counts as online submission - they want to cut their effort and costs, not yours. However we have automated this process such that you can submit your figures directly from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
