    <h1 class="print">Ownership of Transactions by Sectors</h1>
    <p>When you enter a transaction (for example, a <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.purchase ledger" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span> invoice), <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> requires you to select an analysis (for example, a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />, overhead department, or asset).  This analysis will, either directly or indirectly, have a <span class="module">General Ledger</span> account code associated with it, and the account code determines the sector to which that analysis belongs.</p>
    <p>Posting to control accounts will always be to that sector, regardless of how the transaction may later be costed.  In other words, sector<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation is not by costing distribution, but by the sector to which the "owning entity" belongs.</p>
    <p>With Sector<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed Balance Sheets enabled, posting to control accounts will always be to that sector, regardless of how the transaction may later be costed.</p>
