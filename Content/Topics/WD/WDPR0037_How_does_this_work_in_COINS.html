    <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">
      <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> and Tax Schemes</h2>
    <p>The most common configuration is to have each <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> as a separate tax scheme. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can handle more than one scheme in a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />, or a scheme that uses a number of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" />.</p>
    <p>If you hold some of the employees in the scheme on <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> and others elsewhere (such as paid by bureau) then you will need to make a part submission from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, and a part submission from elsewhere. Finally you will need to submit the P35 part probably by typing it in on the IR website.</p>
    <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.2 ">Forms</h2>
    <p>The P35 is a summary of NI and PAYE for the year.</p>
    <p>The P14 and P60 forms are two copies of the same form; the P60 is given to all current employees, HMRC get a P14 for all employees. HMRC require a P14 for an employee unless they:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>are a full time student employed during their <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holidays" /> in which case they require a P38S.</li>
      <li>earn less than the Lower Earnings Limit (LEL) in which case they require a P38A.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The P35 and P14s are all included in the electronic EOY Return. There is no need to make a return for P38s, though you must complete the form and retain in case of HMRC inspection.</p>
    <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.3 ">No more End of Year Environments</h2>
    <p>Formerly some users chose to copy the live database to an environment where they could reconcile their figures without the deadline of the first payment of the new tax year. Often this resulted in users forgetting to replicate the changes on live once the year-end process was complete. <strong><em>We recommend that you no longer do this.</em></strong></p>
    <p>You can now update all the figures that will be returned, even after you have run the year-end procedure on <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
