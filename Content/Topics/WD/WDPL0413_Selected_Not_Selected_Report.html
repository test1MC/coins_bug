        <h1 class="print">Selected/Not Selected Report</h1>
        <p><span class="function" title="Function:%WPL3030RCUR">Selected/Not Selected Report</span> allows you to produce a report that shows details of outstanding transactions selected or not selected for payment. The report is broken down and totalled by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" /> and shows the balance for each transaction, the total amount still payable and the amounts, if any, that have been selected to be paid. The report indicates whether transactions were selected via Batch Selection or via Manual Selection. If there are any unallocated amounts that exist for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" />, these are shown to the right of the report. Details of any transactions on hold that require approval before being paid are also shown.</p>
        <p>If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" />'s account balance would become negative if the selected invoices were paid, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will display the message: "Neg Balance" to the right of the report. If there is a negative balance existing on a related S/C account, then <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays the message: "Warning: Negative Balance on S/C Account" next to the appropriate <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" /> details.</p>
        <p>An aged analysis of the payment run is shown at the end of the report.</p>
        <p>You may run the selected/not selected report at any time during the payment run process.</p>
