        <h1 class="print">Distributing Invoice Costs</h1>
        <p>If you are costing or provisionally costing an invoice, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays the <span class="field">Costing Distribution </span>frame:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images_P-R/PL/PL_021301.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>This allows you to identify how the costs of the invoice are allocated.</p>
        <p>Enter a new costing line for each analysis (for example, to a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />, a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> analysis or <span class="module">General Ledger </span>account), with the amount to be costed to that analysis.</p>
        <p>If you are provisionally costing the invoice, you will need to amend or confirm the costing later (see <a href="WDPL0321_Costing_Invoices_By_Batch.html">Costing Invoices By Batch</a>).</p>
        <p>The sum of all the analysis lines must equal the costable amount of the invoice (that is, net amount + non-recoverable <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" />).</p>
