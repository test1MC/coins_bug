        <h1 class="print">Report Writer</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /><span class="function" title="Function:%WSY2400BRTN">Report Writer</span> allows you to produce powerful column-based reports across the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> system quickly and easily. Starting with a predefined query, <span class="function" title="Function:%WSY2400BRTN">Report Writer</span> guides you through the process of defining the layout and content of the report.</p>
        <p><span class="function" title="Function:%WSY2400BRTN">Report Writer</span> can be used ?out of the box? - it comes with over 1200 default queries, through the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Business Logic, that provide access to every table in the system. </p>
        <h2>Licensing</h2>
        <p><span class="function" title="Function:%WSY2400BRTN">Report Writer</span> is a separately licensed module.&#160; It is normally paired with a Report Runner <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> which allows sharing of Report Writer reports across client-defined user groups.&#160; Administrator training is required for at least one resource, in conjunction with the licensing. </p>
        <h2>Delivering Report Writer</h2>
        <p>&#160;The Report Writer training course is delivered as two separate training methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="WDSY0145_Administrator_Training.html">Report Writer Administrator Training</a>
            </li>

            <h2 class="print">To define a new report using Report Writer:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to <span class="function" title="Function:%WSY2400BRTN">Report Writer</span> and click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/add.svg" class="button" /> [Add] to add a new report.</li>
                <li>Give the report a name, and a description. The name identifies the report in, among other places, the <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBCRR">Report Status</span> screen.</li>
                <li>Click to choose a query to base the report on. A query is a pre-defined section of Progress 4GL code that selects the records that the report will include. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> comes with a number of pre-installed queries; your system administrator may have also prepared queries. You can modify the basic query by setting up filters (to restrict the information that is included), groups and sort orders.
<p class="noteheader">NOTE</p><p class="note" style="text-indent: 0pt;">Queries are filtered by table security; you will only see queries for which you have access to all the tables.</p></li>
                <li>Choose whether to show grand totals at the end of the report. (This will show totals for the fields you mark as being totalled.)</li>
                <li>Select one of the pre-defined page layouts. The page layout defines the size of the report page, its orientation (landscape or portrait), and margins.</li>
                <li>Select one of the pre-defined classes for the report. The report class defines the font, size and formatting of the body text of the report, and of the headers, footers and totals.
<p>If a graph is required on the report then select the graph type to be included on report.</p><p>If you want to report on a selected number of records then you can enter a number in the Maximum Rows field to limit the number of rows on the report. (Eg:- useful if you want to report on the Top 5).</p></li>
                <li>On the Filter tab, select the fields you want to evaluate to decide whether to include the record on the report. For example, to include only <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" /> in London, select <span class="userinput"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Location </span>from the Filter list, select <span class="userinput">Equals </span>from the comparison list, and type <span class="userinput">London </span>in the value field. See <a href="WDSY0042_Filtering_Report_Data.html">Report Writer - Filtering Report Data</a>.</li>
                <li>On the Group tab, choose how you want the report to be grouped, sorted and totalled. You can choose to have a header line before each group (that shows the value of the <span class="field">Group By </span>field), and a footer line after each group (that shows the totals for any fields you mark as being totalled). See <a href="WDSY0043_Grouping_Report_Data.html">Report Writer - Grouping Report Data</a>.</li>
                <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/save.svg" class="button" /> to save the report at this point.</li>
                <li>On the Fields tab, select the fields to include on the report.
<ol><li>To select a single field, double-click the field in the <span class="field">Available </span>box. (You can also double-click a field in the <span class="field">Selected </span>box to remove it.)</li><li>To select several fields at the same time, hold down the <span class="key">Ctrl</span> key and click the fields. Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/listadd.svg" class="button" /> [Add] to move the fields into the <span class="field">Selected: </span>box.
<p><img src="../../Resources/Images/SY/SY_004101.gif" />&#160;</p></li><li>To change the order the fields will appear on the report, select a field or fields in the <span class="field">Selected: </span>box and use the <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/moveup.svg" class="button" /> [Move Up] and <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/movedown.svg" class="button" /> [Move Down] buttons to move them up or down.</li></ol><p>You can change the column labels and widths, and specify whether you want the columns totalled, when you modify the report later; see <a href="WDSY0044_Modifying_Fields.html">Report Writer - Modifying Fields</a>.</p></li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 1em;">Save the report.</span>
