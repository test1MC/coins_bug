        <h1 class="print">Bringing a Company into Your View</h1>
        <p>If you want to work with a company in the Company Information Workbench that is not in your view, you can bring it into base (lowest) view, from levels above your base view. </p>
        <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
        <div class="note">Other users (for example, colleagues with similar responsibilities) may share your user view.&#160; If you add a company, the other users who share your base view will also see the new company.&#160; If you remove a company from your view, the other users will no longer have it in their view either.</div>
