    <h1 class="print">Bulk Orders</h1>
    <p>A bulk order is an order for an approximate quantity — such as for readymix — which will typically be delivered in several deliveries over a period of time.</p>
    <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
    <div class="note">A bulk order is one with quantity class <strong>E</strong>. Order types are defined using <span class="function" title="Function:%WPO2010BPOT">Purchase Order Types</span>.</div>
    <p>When printed, the order has wording such as <span class="field">Approx</span> printed below the quantity. Unlike normal orders, it is not marked as complete when invoices for the ordered amount have been received; you must complete it manually (using <span class="function" title="Function:%WPO101ABPHL">Material Orders</span>).</p>
    <p>Entering a bulk order is very similar to entering a material order. The differences are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the <span class="field">Type</span> field, enter the code for bulk orders (for example, <strong>B</strong>).</li>
      <li>You do not need to enter a due date.</li>
    </ul>
