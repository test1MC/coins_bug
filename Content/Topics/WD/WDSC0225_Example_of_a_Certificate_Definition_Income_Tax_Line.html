        <h1 class="print">Example of a Certificate Definition - Income Tax Line</h1>
        <p>Income tax is calculated from the Gross, less any Retention, Discount or Materials costs.</p>
        <p>The income tax line looks like this:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images_S-U/SC/SC_022501.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The <span class="field">Rate</span> field on a tax line is ignored; set it to 0. The Income Tax percentage is taken from the parameter <span class="parameter">PAYE%</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <span class="field">Calc Cumulative</span>field is un<MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed, since Income Tax is calculated on this payment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The user cannot override the tax paid, so the <span class="field">Update</span> field is un<MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed. This is because <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> recommends calculating the amount of tax again at point of payment so any changes made here would be lost.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This will calculate the amount of income tax to be deducted. You have to subtract this in the <span class="field">Subtotals</span>field of the payment line.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> takes account of whether the subcontractor has a valid CIS tax certificate.</p>
        <p>
            <br /> <strong>What if the Income Tax rate changes?</strong></p>
        <p>If the Income Tax rate changes, on the day the rate changes you must change the value on the <span class="parameter">PAYE%</span>parameter.</p>
