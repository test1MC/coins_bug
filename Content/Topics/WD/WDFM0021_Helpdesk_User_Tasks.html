    <h1 class="print">Helpdesk User Tasks</h1>
    <p>The Helpdesk User deals with telephone calls from clients. FM will enable him/her to do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="WDFM0033_Searching_for_a__Location.html">Verify location details</a>.</li>
      <li>Check caller/location history for previous <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm jobs" />.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="WDFM0010_Logging_a_New_Job.html">Record details of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm job" /></a>.</li>
      <li>Diagnose the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm job" /> by selecting a Job Type (this will implicitly choose the trade and duration) of the work.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="WDFM0038_Escalating_a_Job.html">Allow for awkward <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm jobs" />, such as <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm jobs" /> that cannot be diagnosed by the Helpdesk</a>.</li>
      <li>Give the caller a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm job" /> reference number.</li>
      <li>Log any Access Notes.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="WDFM0015_Booking_an_Appointment.html">Give the caller appointment details</a> (these will be trade specific appointments but NOT <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> specific appointments).</li>
      <li>Display a visual view of the resource availability (taking into account that the trade and duration have been diagnosed at this point).</li>
      <li>Log the appointment in the system.</li>
      <li>Process multi-appointments for certain <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm jobs" />. </li>
      <li>

      <li>Update any changes to the contact details at the location, including hazards.</li>
      <li>Record missed appointments and reschedule, including the reason for cancellation.</li>
      <li>Stop the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fm job" /> and cancel any related tasks.</li>
