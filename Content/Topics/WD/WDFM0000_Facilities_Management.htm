        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Facilities Management" /> (FM) is an integrated module of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> that will be used primarily by specialist contractors who provide facilities management services to multiple property owners and managers.  Typically these would include city councils and/or housing associations, residential building stock or commercial property owners, in fact all who require that their buildings are covered by both reactive and scheduled planned property maintenance services.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Facilities Management" /> module enables a company to look after the buildings and associated services maintenance needs, to monitor and schedule the work required, and assign the tasks to the right tradesman, record the hours of maintenance / repair work and also schedule regular service work, like meter readings, boilers and HVAC equipment.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Facilities Management" /> module can be integrated to other <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> modules including Financial Ledgers and Payroll, Fixed Assets, Procurement and Stock.</p>
        <p>The key roles that can be identified when using the FM module, are the help desk user, the scheduler, the building surveyor and the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operatives" /> doing the work on location.</p>
