        <h1 class="print">Depreciation Methods</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> allows for four methods of depreciation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Straight line (spread evenly over the life of the asset).
<p><img src="../../Resources/Images_D-F/Fixed Assets/FA_001101.gif" /></p></li>
            <li>Reducing balance (reducing by a percentage of the current value for each period or number of units).
<p><img src="../../Resources/Images_D-F/Fixed Assets/FA_001102.gif" /></p><p>If the rate of depreciation was 20%, the unit was T, and the initial asset value was <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />100, the asset would depreciate as follows: in the first year, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />20; in the second year, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />16 (that is, 20% of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />80, the WDV at the end of the first year); in the third year, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />12.80 (that is, 20% of the WDV at the end of the second year).</p></li>
            <li>Diminishing line (as reducing balance, except that the depreciation is distributed evenly over the year with the gradient of the line changing at year-end).
<p><img src="../../Resources/Images_D-F/Fixed Assets/FA_001103.gif" /></p><p>For example, if the rate is set at 10%, the asset will depreciate 10% in the first year, and in the second year 10% of the value remaining.</p></li>
            <li>True year diminishing line (as diminishing line, except that the change of rate occurs on the anniversary of the asset’s depreciation start date rather than at the end of the company year).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As well as depreciating assets over time, you can also depreciate assets on a different basis, such as mileage or hours used.</p>
