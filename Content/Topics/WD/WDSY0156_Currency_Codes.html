        <h1 class="print">Currency Codes</h1>
        <p>For each <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> decide what the base currency will be, and what other currencies you will require for foreign accounts, and, if you are going to use alternative base&#160;currencies, what these currencies are.</p>
        <p>Use <span class="function" title="Function:%WCO2001BCUR">Currencies</span> to set up the currency codes required.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>We recommend that you use the ISO standard currency codes; for example, GBP, USD, AUD. ISO currency codes are normally formed of the two-character ISO country code, plus an extra character which is usually the initial letter of the currency name. There are some exceptions; EUR is the ISO code for Euros, and RUB for Russian roubles. </li>
                <li>You need to set up the currencies in use for each <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> separately.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Relevant General Ledger Accounts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Exchange Variance GL account is used when a foreign currency invoice is paid, the foreign exchange rate has changed since entry, and the amount paid in foreign currency now represents a different value in Base currency. It should be a P&amp;L account.</li>
            <li>The Unreal<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed Variance GL account is used by the Unreal<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed Variance reports, typically run at the end of each month, to calculate the potential difference if the exchange rate on invoices still on the ledger has moved since they were input. It should be a Balance Sheet account. The opposite side of the GL journal optionally generated by this report is to the relevant ledger control account. </li>
            <li>The Rounding GL account is required for any miscellaneous residual amounts that arise from currency conversion. It should be a P&amp;L account. These amounts are automatically posted there by the various posting programs. Any transaction values should normally be no more than 0.01 or 0.02 for each transaction processed, and there should not be many transactions overall. If there are a significant number of transactions it is an indication that foreign exchange rates are not being entered to an appropriate level of precision ? rates up to 6 decimal places are allowed for. If transactions of substantial value are in this account it is an indication of a configuration error, which should be traced back and the system reconfigured as required to overcome it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you have set up the currencies, enter their exchange rates with the base currency (see <a href="WDSY0157_Exchange_Conversion_Rates.html">Exchange Rates and Conversion Rates</a>). Note that it is not necessary to set all the currencies up immediately.<br /></p>
