    <p>In addition to entering <a href="WDPO0011_Performance_Reviews.html">performance review scores</a>, if necessary you can also record non-conformance incidents against the company.  Non-conformance reviews allow you to enter text about the issue, but do not contribute to the performance scores (although you may want to refer to them when assessing the company's performance). </p>
    <p>There are two types of non-conformance: safety issues and other.  You can only enter one performance review or non-conformance review on any one day (in other words, the entries in the <span class="field">Review Date </span>column must all be different).</p>
    <p>The Score History screens show the number of non-conformance reviews.</p>
