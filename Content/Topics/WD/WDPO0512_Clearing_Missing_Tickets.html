            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Clearing Missing Tickets</h1>
        <p>Missing tickets are entered during invoice matching when the invoice refers to a <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="COINS.Term1">GRN</MadCap:glossaryTerm> which has not been recorded in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. In practice this is typically because the physical delivery note has been lost. Entering a missing ticket allows the invoice to be matched to the purchase order.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> assigns the missing ticket to an owner, based on the settings in <span class="function" title="Function: %WCI9010BWFE">User Roles</span>. The owner of the missing ticket can use <span class="function" title="Function: %WPO1810BPGM">Missing Ticket Workbench</span> to confirm that the goods have been received.</p>
        <p>As each missing ticket is cleared, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> checks the invoice to which it relates. If there are no other missing tickets, and no further price queries on the invoice, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> takes the invoice off hold. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can be configured to prevent you from clearing a ticket if no documents have been attached to it.</p>
        <p>You can report on outstanding (uncleared) missing tickets using <span class="function" title="Function: %WPO3130RPGH">Missing Tickets Report</span>.</p>
