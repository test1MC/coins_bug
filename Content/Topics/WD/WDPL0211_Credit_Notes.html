    <h1 class="print">Credit Notes</h1>
    <p>Credit notes are basically entered in the same way as <a href="WDPL0210_Invoices.html">invoices</a>.   Choose a transaction type that represents credit notes, and enter the amounts as positive values (same as invoices).  However, when completing the batch header for a batch of credit notes, if the <a href="WDUG0054_Batch_Control_Totals.html">control total fields</a> are set up to be input fields, enter the batch control amounts as negative values. </p>
    <p>After you have entered the credit note, you can allocate it to offset invoice values.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Go to <span class="function" title="Function:%WPL1500BCOB">Allocate Credits</span>.</li>
        <li>Enter a new batch.</li>
        <li>Enter a new allocation transaction for each <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" />.</li>
        <li>If you are running a sector-based ledger, you must specify the sector to which you want to apply the payment.
<p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays credit notes and outstanding transactions for the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" />. </p><p>Before allocating (matching) a credit note to a transaction, you can check the invoice or credit note status and other details, by clicking the link in the <span class="field">Internal Reference </span>column.  Click <strong>Back</strong> to return to the list of transactions.</p></li>
        <li>Select the credit notes and the invoices to match (allocate) them to. You can allocate a credit note to pay part of an invoice. The allocation amount must equal zero.
