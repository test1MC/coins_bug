      <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />What Happens If I Need to Change the Payments in a Batch?</h1>
    <p>If for any reason you need to make changes to a frozen payment batch (for example, to add or delete last minute payments, or if you print a cheque by mistake or do not want to issue a cheque you have printed), you can still do so. These changes must be made before the payment batch is posted.</p>
    <div class="process">
      <h2 class="print">To add or delete payments after freezing the batch:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <span class="function" title="Function:%WPL1120BCOB">Payment Batches</span>. 
<p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays a list of payment batches.</p><p class="noteheader">NOTE</p><div class="note">If your system is set to run multi-currencies and/or sector based ledgers, then these will determine whether users are able to create multiple (unposted) payment batches. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> allows for only one payment batch, per currency, per sector. </div></li>
        <li>From the list, select the payment batch or batches that you want to unfreeze.</li>
        <li>Choose <span class="field">Unfreeze Payment Batches </span>from the list.</li>
        <p>You have now unfrozen (re-opened) the payment batch. </p>
        <li>Now you can delete individual payments from the batch, or make the necessary changes to the batch using the selection procedures (see <MadCap:xref href="WDPL0411_Selecting_Invoices_for_Payment.html">Selecting Invoices for Payment</MadCap:xref>).
					<p class="noteheader">NOTE</p><div class="note">If you have already posted the payments you will need to use the Input - <span class="function" title="Function: %WPL7000BCOB">Cancel Payment</span> procedure (see <a href="WDPL0433_What_Happens_If_I_Have_Posted_an_Incorrect_Cheque.html">What Happens If I Have Posted an Incorrect Cheque?</a>).</div></li>
        <li>You need to freeze the batch again before you can process the payments.</li>
      </ol>
