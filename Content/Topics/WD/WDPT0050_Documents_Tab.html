    <p>You can add documents (that is, files of any format, including pictures or spreadsheets, as well as word-processing documents) to any item using the <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/imagelink.svg" class="button" /> button; any documents that have been added to an item are shown on that item's Documents tab.  </p>
    <p>You can also add documents that relate to the whole project. </p>
    <p>Each item's Documents tab shows documents that are associated with that item.</p>
    <p>The Files &gt; Documents tab shows documents that are associated with the project, and with any of the project items.</p>
