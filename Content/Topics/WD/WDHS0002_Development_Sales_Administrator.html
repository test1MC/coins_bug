    <p> </p>
    <p>The Site Sales Administrator is the first contact that prospective buyers will have, and they are also the person to contact about general queries. Other tasks which the Site Sales Administrator must fulfil include: logging details (of buyers and prospective buyers), proactively following up potential sales leads and processing reservation details. At all times the Site Sales Administrator must build and maintain a good relationship with buyers, such as offering advice and guidance, and informing them about sales <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hs extras" /> and options that are available. 
</p>
    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> House Sales will equip the Site Sales Administrator to target high quality potential buyers and efficiently carry out administrative tasks such as production of letters, mail shots and reservation agreements. The in-built <MadCap:variable name="Variables.diary" /> system can prompt the Site Sales Administrator to follow up leads and build a professional relationship with them. Furthermore, the advanced search capabilities will empower the Site Sales Administrator to search for suitable buyers and match them with available plots easily and quickly.</p>
