    <h1 class="print">Item Sequences</h1>
    <p>You can use the <span class="function">Item Sequences</span> function to set up pay item sequences, which are the building blocks of pay items. They control the items that appear on each employee's timesheet and are used in their Payroll calculation.</p>
    <p>For example, if you pay employees with different shift patterns, you can set up different item sequences; when an employee changes to a different shift pattern (or, for example, if they change from being hourly paid to being a salaried employee), you only need to change the employee's sequence.</p>
    <p>Each employee is set up to use one of the sequences. If you add new items to a sequence, they are automatically added to the item record of any employee set up to use that sequence. If you remove an item from a sequence, it no longer features in the calculation for employees using that sequence, though it is retained on the employees' item records so that Payroll history information is complete.</p>
    <p>Pay item sequences are not <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />-specific; you can use any sequence in any <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> and with any pay frequency.</p>
