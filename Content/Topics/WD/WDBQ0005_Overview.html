        <h1 class="print">Bill of Quantities Overview</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> House Builders Bill of Quantities provides estimators, surveyors and buyers with an integrated solution for managing resource requirements involved in housing construction.</p>
        <p>Bill of Quantities allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create cost estimates for house types</li>
            <li>Build up detailed bills for house types, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vp sites" /> and plots</li>
            <li>Raise orders in Procurement.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Update and maintain site cost forecasts based on amendments to the bill of quantities</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Manage the various differing requirements of house type variants</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It offers flexibility to incorporate both lump sums and detailed bills of quantity for materials, subcontract, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" /> and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour" />.</p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images_A-C/BQ/BQ_000001.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <h2>BOQ Interfaces with other modules</h2>
        <p>In conjunction with the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> modules <span class="module">Procurement</span>, <span class="module">Financials </span>and <span class="module">Valuations and Automated Payments </span>(VAP), the whole process from initial estimate through procurement to payment can be managed seamlessly.</p>
        <p>The high level of integration with the rest of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> significantly increases the use which can be made of the information stored, allowing buyers and estimators to access all relevant information from the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> database subject to security constraints.</p>
        <p><span class="module">Bill of Quantities</span> requires <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /><span class="module">Procurement</span> to be configured.</p>
        <h2>Key Business and Functional Processes Supported</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain bills of quantity</li>
            <li>Raise orders</li>
            <li>Raise variation orders</li>
            <li>Maintain and apply prices</li>
            <li>House type variants</li>
            <li>Update VAP budgets</li>
            <li>Workflow activities, emails and alerts</li>
            <li>Dynamic reporting</li>
            <li>VAP budgets, valuations and payments can be updated from BOQ</li>
            <li>Material and subcontract orders can be generated in <span class="module">Procurement</span></li>
            <li>Orders can feed into the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR" /> module</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Estimating</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Bill of Quantities module can be used to produce estimates for house building projects, giving flexibility to work at different levels of detail for different items as required.</p>
        <p> Estimates may include the following types of cost:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Materials</li>
            <li>Subcontract</li>
            <li>Plant</li>
            <li>Labour</li>
            <li>Preliminaries</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Key estimating features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detailed item lines can be directly input, copied from other plots or house types, or imported from spreadsheets. They can also be exported to spreadsheets.</li>
            <li>Dim sheets can be used to calculate quantities and stored to support the bill detail.</li>
            <li>Wastage factors can be built in to material quantities with labour values based on net quantities and material values based on gross quantities.</li>
            <li>Prices can be input either net or gross (with separate discount). </li>
            <li>Free of charge items can be flagged so that any unpriced items can be identified.</li>
            <li>Prices can be held at global, company or site level either as a general or supplier-specific price. </li>
            <li>Prices can be indicated as estimated or agreed.</li>
            <li>Multiple levels of “Intelligent Resources” allow for composite items such as square metres of cavity wall to be incorporated in bills.</li>
            <li>House type variants allow for different versions of a standard house type to be managed without duplication of unaffected bill items.</li>
            <li>Special facilities are included for materials which require lengths to be specified (for example, timber).</li>
            <li>Incorporate non-plot costs using dummy house types and plots.</li>
            <li>Update VAP budgets from the bill in part or in full and store snapshot of the bill for later enquiry/reporting.</li>
            <li>Flexible reporting using the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Open Architecture reporting toolset.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Purchase Ordering</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Bill of Quantities module can be used in conjunction with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Procurement to automatically generate orders for house building developments from the bill of quantities. </p>
        <p>Several types of purchase orders are produced:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Materials</li>
            <li>Subcontract</li>
            <li>Variation orders</li>
            <li>Cancellation orders</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Key purchase order features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>See at a glance which packages and items have been ordered for which plots with easy access to full details of related bill items, orders, variation orders, deliveries and invoices.</li>
            <li>Nominate suppliers and apply agreed prices to bill items either just before raising the order or as soon as the information is available.</li>
            <li>Raise orders from bills of quantity for bulk materials (as a total quantity), plot sets and subcontracts.</li>
            <li>Highly configurable format for printing of orders.</li>
            <li>Add clauses, text and other information to orders in a flexible but controlled process.</li>
            <li>Raise variation orders from amended bills of quantity for quantity and price changes as well as for lines added or deleted and resources substituted.</li>
            <li>Easily cancel the balance of orders for undelivered plots.</li>
            <li>Re-order replacement materials where required as a result of damage, theft and so on (subject to appropriate security controls).</li>
        </ul>
