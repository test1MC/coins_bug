    <h1 class="print">Sector-Secure Ledgers</h1>
    <p>You can divide your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> into different sectors (for example, different branches), and only allow users to see and access transactions in the sector(s) to which they belong. This allows you, for example, to have Sales, Purchase and Subcontractor Ledgers which appear as separate ledgers for different branches, while still appearing as single ledgers for head office. See <a href="WDGL0020_Sectors.html">Sectors</a>. </p>
