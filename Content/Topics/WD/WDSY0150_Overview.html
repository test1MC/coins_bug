    <h1 class="print">Overview of Multi-Currency Features</h1>
    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> provides the facility to operate with multiple currencies, for transaction processing and reporting. Multi currency usage requires configuring the system to use these different currencies, and gives further options to use this in reports.</p>
    <p>The key elements of Multi Currency are :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A "Base" currency, which can be different for each <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />, and which by default that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> operates in.</li>
      <li>Exchange rates maintained by the user.</li>
      <li>The ability to specify different currencies on different accounts (<MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" />, customers, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" />, bank accounts etc), and have different currency values calculated as transactions are input or processed, generally known as "Foreign Currency".</li>
      <li>The conversion of any foreign currency values at point of input into "Base" currency, which allows standard<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed reporting throughout the system.</li>
      <li>Calculation of potential exchange differences, as a provision, when currency rates change and transactions are still held in the system (unreal<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed variance).</li>
      <li>Specific processing of currency aspects such as actual exchange variances at point of payment, and the costing of these.</li>
      <li>The ability to produce financial reports in a range of different currencies, generally known as "Alternative Base Currency".</li>
      <li>Standard reports throughout the system able to be run in a range of currencies.  For example <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" /> reports can be run in the account currency or all <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" /> can be reported in the base currency, or one of the alternative base currencies.</li>
      <li>Detailed provision for aspects of foreign currency contracting, such as client billing in a different currency to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> cost/revenue reporting currency; multiple clients on the same <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />, each working in a different currency, etc.</li>
      <li>Production of consolidated Balance Sheets and other financial reports across <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" />, which merge different <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" /> working in different base currencies.</li>
    </ul>
