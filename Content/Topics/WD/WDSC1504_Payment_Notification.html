        <p>Payment notification is the electronic process under the eRCT scheme for notifying Revenue of any proposed payment to be made under a Relevant Contract.&#160; There is a legal requirement to notify Revenue of any proposed payment to be made under a Relevant Contract before making any such payment.&#160; On receipt of the Payment Notification, Revenue will advise the Principal of the amount of tax to be deducted from the payment, if any.&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>
