    <h1 class="print">Function Access Security</h1>
    <p>You can control which users have access to which functions. For any user, you can control whether or not they have access to any given function. You can also give groups of users the same permissions. See <a href="WDSY0017_How_Function_Access_Works.html">How Function Access Works</a>. It is important that you ensure that users do not have access to functions they should not be allowed to use. For example: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBSUR">Users</span> and <span class="function" title="Function:%WMS2034BMSF">User Function Access</span> form part of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> security, and so only those users who have responsibility for security, such as the System Administrator, should be allowed access to these procedures. </li>
      <li>Management reporting functions may not be relevant to data entry staff, so these staff members do not need access to these functions. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Obviously, the access you allow or disallow depends on the requirements of your business and the responsibility of individuals within it. <br /></p>
