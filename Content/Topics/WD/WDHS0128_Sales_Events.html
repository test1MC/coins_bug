    <p>
      <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS2011BHEV">Sales Workbench Events</span> allows you to set up the events you can run for a plot sale. These include events to release or rerelease a plot, record a reservation, complete a sale, and record various other events in the progress of a sale.</p>
    <div class="process">
      <h2 class="print">To set up sales events:</h2>
      <ol>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS2011BHEV">Sales Workbench Events</span>.</li>
          <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/add.svg" class="button" /> to add a new event.</li>
          <li>Enter a code for the new event.</li>
          <li>If the event is one that is not run manually from the <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS1010SHCG">Sales Workbench</span> but is run automatically by a process like sending a letter, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /><span class="field">System Generated</span>.</li>
          <li>Select the system event. This determines the type of event you are setting up. You need to set up at least one release, re-release, reservation, exchange and completion event. Also for <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/coinsOA.flsnp" /> you need to setup a cancellation event.</li>
          <li>Enter a full description for the event. (The short description is only used in <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/COINSplus.flsnp" />.)</li>
          <li>If you want to allow users to run the event more than once, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /><span class="field">Allow Duplicates</span>.</li>
          <li>If you want the event to be author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed separately after it has been entered, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /><span class="field">Event Requires Author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation?</span>. See <a href="WDHS0129_Authorised_Sales_Events.html">Author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed Sales Events</a>.</li>
          <li>If you are setting up a conditional exchange event (system event code EXCHANGE) <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /><span class="field">Conditional Exchange </span>and enter the corresponding unconditional exchange event on the Conditional Exchange tab.</li>
          <li>If you only want to allow the event to be run if other specified events have already been run, enter the codes for those events in the <span class="field">Previous Events </span>field. For example, to set up a "Reserve" event that can only be run if the "Release" event has already been run, enter the code for the "Release" event.</li>
          <li>If you want to prevent the event if other specified events have already been run, enter the codes for those events in the <span class="field">Stop Events </span>field.</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
      <p class="note">If you want to allow or prevent the event depending on whether the status of the plot is "released", use the token <span class="screentype">$RELEASE</span>. (You need to use this, rather than the RELEASE event code, because released plots can be dereleased.) For example, if you put <span class="screentype">$RELEASE</span> in the <span class="field">Previous Events</span> field, you will only be able to run the event if the plot is currently released.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>To restrict how many days before or after today users can enter for the date of the event, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the <span class="field">Restrict Backdating </span>or <span class="field">Restrict Forward Dating </span>field (or both), and enter the number of days. For example, to stop users entering a date more than two days before today, set <span class="field">Allowable Days Backdating</span> to <span class="userinput">2</span>. If both are set to <span class="userinput">0</span>, users will be forced to enter today's date.</li>
        <li>Select the sales status that this event will apply to the plot.</li>
        <li>If you are setting up a RESERVE event, from the <span class="field">Incomplete Reservation Sales Status </span>list select the sales status code that the plot will have (in <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/coinsOA.flsnp" />) while the reservation is in progress but has not been completed.</li>
        <li>To prevent the event from changing certain sales status codes, enter a can-do list in the <span class="field">Stop Status Update </span>field to specify the codes. For example, the pre-release reservation event might normally change the sales status to EB (earlybird), but not if the sales status is already released; to do this, you would put EB in the <span class="field">Sales Status Update</span> field and RL (for released) in the <span class="field">Stop Status Update</span> field.</li>
        <li>From the <span class="field">Minimum Construction Stage </span>list, select the construction stage that the plot must reach before the event can be run. For example, you would set the legal completion event so that it cannot be run if the plot construction is not finished.</li>
        <li>Enter the default comments; this is the text that will appear in the <span class="field">Comments</span> field when the event is run (the user can enter different text if they want).</li>
        <li>If the event is a pre-release reservation event, select the <span class="field">Reservation Type</span> on the Prerelease Reservation Type tab; this is the reservation type that this event represents. To allow the user to fill in the reservation type when they record the pre-release, leave the field blank.</li>
        <li>If you want to update captions when the event is run, select the caption groups to update.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="configuration">
      <h2 class="print">Sales Events - configuration</h2>
      <p>Set up which users can run the event, using <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS2011BCOS">Sales Event Security</span> (see <a href="WDHS5001_Event_Security.html">Event Security</a>).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>To copy the comments for the event to the Notes automatically, enter the event code as one of the values of the HS parameter <span class="parameter">COMNTVIS</span>.</p>
