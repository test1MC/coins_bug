        <p>Having selected <MadCap:variable name="Variables.leaver employee" style="text-transform: capitalize;" />&#160;Forms, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr starter" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Forms, or Pension Notification Forms from the pop-up menu, the browse lists the forms within that category. You can use <span class="key">F8</span> to toggle the sort/search between employee number, name, and NINO. You also have <span class="key">F9</span>/<span class="key">F10</span> options to Add/Delete forms. <strong>Add</strong> will be required for pension notifications, and you can use <strong>Delete</strong> to remove new starts that you want to postpone reporting until the next return.</p>
        <p><span class="key">F7</span> can be used to change the form type.&#160;This can be used to select between P45(3) and P46 for a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr starter" />.&#160;It can also be used to set the form type to NONE, which means the form will not be included in the return, and the form will not be added to the next return (for circumstances where there is no requirement to submit a return for that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr starter" />/<MadCap:variable name="Variables.leaver employee" />).</p>
        <p>Pressing <span class="key">Return</span> will access the appropriate form. The following screenshot shows a form P45(3) for a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr starter" /> (the fields displayed are dependent on the form type):</p>

        </p>
        <p>Any details can be edited on each form as required prior to completion and submission. Amending the employee details on the form will also update the main <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> payroll employee record. Alternatively, details can be updated on the employee maintenance screen (which can be accessed using <span class="key">F11</span> from the workbench), and this will also update the form.<br /></p>
