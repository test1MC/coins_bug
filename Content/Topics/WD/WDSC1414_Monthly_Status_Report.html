    <h1 class="print">Monthly Status Report</h1>
    <p>The <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC7540RCOG">Monthly Status Report</span> allows you to check that you are ready to run the month-end process, and to check at the end of the process that you have completed the process satisfactorily.</p>
    <p>Before running the month-end process, the main reason for running the <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC7540RCOG">Monthly Status Report</span> is to show if there is any unallocated cash or unposted batches.  After running the month-end process, the main reason is to check the submission status and show any negative submissions.</p>
    <p>You can run the report for all <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" />, groups of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" />, or the current <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> only.</p>
    <p>For each <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />, the report shows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether the month-end process is "Not Started", "Incomplete" or "Complete".</li>
      <li>Whether the submissions are Complete (HMRC has accepted the submission), or how many are Incomplete or Failed. </li>
      <li>Whether all monthly statements of deductions have been printed ("Complete") or how many have not been printed.</li>
      <li>Whether there are any negative returns, and how many you have not flagged as notified.  If so, you will need to notify HRMC separately.  See <a href="WDSC1420_Negative_Returns.html">Negative Returns</a>.</li>
      <li>Whether there are any unallocated subcontractor payments, and how many.  If so you will be unable to run the month-end process until the cash has been allocated.</li>
      <li>Whether there are any unposted payment batches, and how many.  If so you will be unable to run the month-end process until the batches have been posted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The detail section lists any negative values, unallocated cash and unposted payment batches. <br /></p>
