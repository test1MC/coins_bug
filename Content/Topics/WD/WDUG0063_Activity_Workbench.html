        <p>The Activity Workbench acts as a combined appointments <MadCap:variable name="Variables.diary" /> and "to do" list.&#160; You can record activities (appointments or tasks) for yourself, or assign them to other users.&#160; Several programs throughout <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can generate entries in the workbench automatically as a result of other processes.&#160; Activities are also called actions.</p>
        <p>If new activities are assigned to you, the indicator on your profile picture (<span data-mce-mark="1">in the page header at the top&#160;of the screen) </span>shows the number of activities: <img src="../../Resources/Images/osactions.png" />.&#160; If you move the mouse pointer over the image, the Activity Workbench&#160;<a href="WDUG0096_Popup_Menus.html">popup menu</a> shows the activities.</p>

        <p>The workbench has different views and various filters, allowing you to see, for example, all tasks and appointments for today, all new (unread) tasks and appointments, all outstanding tasks, multiple day view and other users' activities.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> highlights overdue activities in red.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can update Microsoft Outlook<sup>®</sup> regularly with tasks and appointments from the Activity Workbench, so you can keep track of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> activities and entries from outside <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> in the same place.</p>
