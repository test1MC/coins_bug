        <h1 class="print">Understanding the Protocols</h1>
        <p>Submission is a two-sided conversation rather than simply sending the data.&#160;When the data is submitted, there are a number of possible responses, and each response requires further action.&#160;The rules of this <MadCap:variable name="Variables.dialogue" /> are known as the ?Protocol?, and the stage you have reached is known as the ?State?.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will submit the return using a background process.&#160;You will be shown the progress on screen, but note that exiting this screen will not stop the background process.&#160;The reason for using a background process is technical; the PROGRESS session that creates the XML file has to be run with a UTF-8 code page so that the gateway will be able to read it.</p>
