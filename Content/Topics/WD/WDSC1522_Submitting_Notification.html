        <h1 class="print">Submitting Contract Notifications</h1>
        <p>Under the RCT scheme, principal contractors are required to register any new relevant contract with Revenue.&#160; Electronic contract notification submits this notification electronically, and updates the relevant information in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. Within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, a relevant contract could be represented by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A subcontract record.</li>
            <li>A subcontract order or purchase order.</li>
            <li>An ongoing contract, recorded on the subcontractor record.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            <ol>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC1500HSFY">Contract Notification Workbench</span>.
<p>The Current tab shows <a href="WDSC1523_Creating_Notification_Records.html">notification records</a> that have not yet been submitted or have recently been submitted. To begin with, the <span class="field">Status </span>column shows Incomplete for new notification records.</p><img src="../../Resources/Images_S-U/SC/SC_152201.png" class="FullWidth" /></li>
                    <li>To see what information a notification record still needs, click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/detail.svg" class="button" />; any incomplete or invalid data will be highlighted.</li>
                    <li>Update the record and complete the contract details: this is likely to be necessary for all new contract notifications in order to answer the questions required by Revenue.&#160; The questions are dependent on whether the subcontractor has an Irish Tax Reference and whether it is a Labour Only contract or not.
<p>The <span class="field">Status </span>column shows Ready if all the information is valid.&#160;</p></li>
                    <li>Select the notification record or records you want to submit, choose the <span class="userselect">Submit to Revenue </span>action, and click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/actiongo.svg" class="button" />.
<p><img src="../../Resources/Images_S-U/SC/SC_1552202.png" /></p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays the <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC1510USFY">Submit to Revenue</span> screen.</li>
                    <li>Choose the output options for the submission report.&#160;
<p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> submits to Revenue any records with a status of Ready.&#160; (Other records will be listed on an error report.)</p></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a notification is successful, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> updates the Contract Notification records with the contract ID and the date and UserID for the notification, and&#160;sets the status to 'Notified'.&#160; <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> also updates the details on the source record (for example, the subcontract or subcontractor record).</li>
                        <li>If an individual notification is unsuccessful, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> records the errors on the Contract Notification record and set the status to 'Error'.&#160; This does not stop other records submitted at the same time from being processed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
            </ol>
            <p>When the notifications have been submitted successfully, it is then possible to make payments for the contract.</p>
