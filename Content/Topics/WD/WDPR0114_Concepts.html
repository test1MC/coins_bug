    <p>Automatic pension <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enrolment" /> is a requirement for UK employers.  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> determines whether employees should be enrolled into a pension scheme, and if so <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enrol" />s them automatically, and automatically generates the notifications which are required at various stages of the process.</p>
    <p>Each employee is categor<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed as one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Eligible Jobholder </strong>- a worker who normally works in the UK, is aged between 22 and the state pension age (SPA) and has qualifying earnings above the earnings trigger point for auto-<MadCap:variable name="Variables.enrolment" />. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will automatically <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enrol" /> these employees into a pension scheme if they are not in one already, though they can choose to opt out.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Non-eligible Jobholder </strong>? a worker who normally works in the UK, is aged between 16 and 74, has qualifying earnings and does not meet the criteria to be an eligible jobholder. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will not automatically <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enrol" /> these employees, but they can choose to opt in to a qualifying pension scheme.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Entitled Worker </strong>? a worker who normally works in the UK, is aged between 16 and 74 and does not have any qualifying earnings. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will not automatically <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enrol" /> them, but they can choose to join a pension scheme (which does not need to meet the conditions to be a qualifying pension scheme).</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Non-entitled Worker </strong>? an employee who does not match any of the above categories. There is nothing to do for these employees.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A <strong>qualifying pension scheme </strong>is one which meets the minimum contribution levels required by law.</p>
