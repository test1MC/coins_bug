        <p>Once a report has been created in <span class="function" title="Function:%WSY2400BRTN">Report Writer</span> the author can then publish this report to the appropriate <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> User Groups. </p>
        <p>Thus users who have access both to the <span class="function" title="Function:%WSY2430BRTN">Report Runner</span> and the defined User Group will have access to the run the report via the <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBCRR">Report Status</span> Workbench.</p>
        <p />
        <p>To publish a report, access the Publish tab and simply select the User Groups as required from the available list using the green and red arrows to select and deselect respectively. </p>
        <p>You can use the filter to find the fields you require. Simply type in a few letters of the field or label required and the list will be dynamically filtered. </p>
