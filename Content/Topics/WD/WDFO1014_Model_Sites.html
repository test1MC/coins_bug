        <p>Model Sites allows developments to be added to the forecast that represent future developments, even though the sites themselves may not have been identified yet.</p>

        <p>Unlike current sites, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.La Land Management caps" /> model sites are appraisals that are not based on real development opportunities, but model the kind of sites that are expected to be completed in the future. Over a longer term forecast, future sites may not have been identified but these can still be cash flowed and included in Forecasting.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Select the site to be used from the drop-down list. The cashflow appraisal attached to that site will be used in the forecast.</li>
                    <li>Select the month and year in which the model site is scheduled to start (this is independent of any start date used in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.La Land Management caps" />).</li>
                    <li>Add model sites to a forecast using <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/add.svg" class="button" />.

Adding sites in this way, by choosing them from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.La Land Management caps" />, allows the same model to be used more than once in a forecast so that it is not necessary to create more than one model of the same size and scope.<br /></div>
