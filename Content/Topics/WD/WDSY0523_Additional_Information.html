    <h2>Using terminology tokens</h2>
    <p>
      <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />If you edit copies of existing topics, you may see terms contained within curly brackets "\<MadCap:variable name="Variables.\" />". These are terminology tokens, which allow terms used in one language (such as British English) to be substituted with terms in another language (such as American English). You do not need to be concerned with these tokens and may leave them as is. However, if you would like a further explanation of what terminology tokens are and how they are used, please refer to <a href="WDSY0119_Customising_COINS_Using_Terminology.html">Custom<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ing <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Using Terminology</a> on the OA Online Documentation Menu.</p>
    <h2>Adding images</h2>
    <p>You may need to insert standard images into your documentation. For this to work correctly, these images must be located on a network drive or other location accessible to anyone using your system. You can then add these images by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the "I" or "J" tokens; or</li>
      <li>Using the Image <img src="../../Resources/Images/image.gif" class="button" /> button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please consult with your System Administrator or Support Representative for more information about adding images.</p>
    <h2>Adding web page references</h2>
    <p>You may find it necessary to refer users to a web page (in other words, URL address) for more information, such as to download software or forms, view previously recorded webinars, etc. This can be done simply by typing the URL address (or copying and pasting it from the source) directly into the text. The example below shows the result of doing this.</p>
    <p class="noteheader">EXAMPLE:</p>
    <div class="note">For more information about <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, go to <a href="http://www.coins-global.com/">http://www.coins-global.com</a>.</div>
    <h2>Removing/deleting menu books and topics</h2>
    <p>If you need to remove/delete a menu book or topic that you have created for online documentation, follow the steps outlined under the "To remove a user-defined topic" section in the OA Online Documentation Menu under <a href="WDDM0017_Modifying_Existing_Topics.html">Modifying Existing Topics</a>.</p>
