    <p>If you have previously entered a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> that still remains partly or fully unallocated, you will at some stage need to allocate it. </p>
    <p>There are different ways to apply unallocated payments to outstanding transactions: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          <span style="color: black;">Apply Unallocated Cash</span>
        </strong> - <strong>(M</strong>anual<strong>)</strong> allows you to apply one payment for a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" /> at a time. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays a list of all the outstanding transactions that exist for the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" />, allowing you to manually select which transactions to apply the payment to. See <a href="WDPL0444_Allocating_a_Single_Payment.html">Allocating a Single Payment</a>. </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          <span style="color: black;">(Auto)</span>
        </strong>
        <strong>Apply Unallocated Cash</strong> - (<strong>A</strong>utomatic) <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays a list of all existing unallocated payments on your system, and will automatically distribute the selected <span class="nw">payment(s)</span> to the oldest due invoices that are not on hold. See <a href="WDPL0445_Allocating_Multiple_Payments.html">Allocating Multiple Payments</a>.  </li>
    </ul>
