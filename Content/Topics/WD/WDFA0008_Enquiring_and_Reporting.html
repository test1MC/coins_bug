      <span class="function" title="Function:%WFA5011BFTV&quot;">Asset Triggers</span> allows you to produce a report that shows which events are due by reporting on expired triggers. You can report on events that will become due in the future by entering a different date to use. You can produce a word-processing merge file containing the data.</p>
