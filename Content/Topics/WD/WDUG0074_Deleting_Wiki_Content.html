    <h1 class="print">Deleting Wiki Content</h1>
    <p>You can only delete content that you have entered.</p>
    <p>You can delete a version of a topic that you created.  If you want to completely remove a topic that has several versions, you would have to delete each version (or use <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBCFO"><MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Browse Topics</span> if you have access to it).</p>
    <p>You can delete an attachment that you have added, but only if no other topics contain links to it.  So for example if an image file is included on another topic, you need to remove the reference to the image on that topic before you can delete the image attachment from the topic it's attached to.</p>
