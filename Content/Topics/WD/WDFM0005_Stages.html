        <h1 class="print">Stages</h1>
        <p>The stage setup will cater for the different steps and stages in the actual category and will depict the workflow. Each stage will have a function and therefore users and roles are granted access by their user groups or user profiles.</p>
        <p>The stages that you enter will have a direct impact on the job as the stages dictate what the process of the job will be.</p>
        <p>You can also have stages that are restricted on how they can be used, for example on used on a specific major category type. Some stages are linked to extra processing, where you mark the job as closed and it is ready for invoicing.</p>
        <p>There are approx 37 stages available and these can be grouped by function or purpose.</p>
        <div class="process">
            <p>Not all jobs will have all the stages and therefore you would select only the ones that follow the progress of the job from start to completion and the last one is “Job Closed”. This ensures that no more tasks or actions can be added to that specific job.</p>

            <p>After you have set up all the stages for the major category, you need to set the rules for the relationships between the different stages.&#160; For example, before 'Confirming All Tasks Are Complete', you have to first 'Confirm All Tasks Have Been Planned'.</p>
