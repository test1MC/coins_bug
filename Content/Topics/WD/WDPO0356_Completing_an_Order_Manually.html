    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> automatically marks a normal purchase order as "complete" if all lines on the order have been invoiced in full. Bulk or call-off orders, however, need to be completed manually, since it is quite likely that the invoiced amount will exceed the amount of the original order. </p>
    <p>Also, you may want to complete a normal order or an individual order line if, for example, you know you are not going to receive the full amount ordered. <br /></p>
