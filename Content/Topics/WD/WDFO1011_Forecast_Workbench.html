        <p>Forecasting data is pulled from across <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> (filtered by the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.La Land Management caps" /> system) when new forecasts are created on the Forecast Workbench. The workbench uses screen layouts devised in user-definable forecast models. Data on the Forecast Workbench can be filtered according to its model type, using the Forecast Model selector at the bottom of the screen.</p>
