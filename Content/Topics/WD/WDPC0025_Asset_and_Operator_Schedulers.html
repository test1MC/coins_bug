    <h1 class="print">Asset and Operator Schedulers</h1>
    <p>The Asset &amp; Operator Schedulers give a time-line view scheduled use of an asset group for a depot.   There is a row per resource (asset or operator) with two additional rows for unassigned tasks and tasks assigned to external resource at the top.   </p>
    <p> You can drag and drop requests to change the assigned resource. When doing so any change in timing is ignored so you don't have to be careful to keep the time the same. If you drag and drop a request to a resource that cannot handle the whole duration, only the first spell that can be handled will be moved and the remainder will be left where it was.  This allows you to split assignments.  If you move a split assignment to a row where it is adjacent to another part of the assignment the parts will merge.</p>
    <p>When a sales order has a quantity there are multiple tasks available to be assigned to individuals or assets.   </p>
    <p>Double-click on an event to open a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.dialogue" /> box with expanded details.  There may be a link from here to further detail.</p>
    <p>In Pending <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc hires" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> the scheduled assets will be pre-assigned when you move to dispatch.  If a trading agreement exists in SRM, then assets assigned to EXTERNAL will default to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc rehire" /> from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" />.</p>
