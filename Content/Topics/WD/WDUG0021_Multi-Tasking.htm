        <h1>Multi-Tasking</h1>
        <p>If you are in the middle of one activity and need to do something else -- for example, if you are creating a supplier record and want to enquire on the payment history of a related supplier, or if you are entering a batch of transactions and want to print a report -- you should open up a new window.
</p>
        <p>When you have finished the new activity, you can return to your original activity and continue.</p>
        <h2>To start up a new window</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">On the current tab of your browser, right-click the tab and select Duplicate </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images_S-U/UG_multi-tasking-1.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Another tab will open in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> which will allow you to navigate and use <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> without affecting the screen you have open in the first tab.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">Using this method does not create another session for the user (therefore has no impact on the number of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licences" /> in use). It only allows the user to multi-task within their current session. Logging out in any tab will close the session for all tabs. <br />Duplicate tabs may be closed without logging out - the first tab will remain logged in.</p>
