    <h1 class="print">Essential Parameters</h1>
    <p>Essential parameters are those parameters that you must set in order for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to work correctly at your site. For example, they may depend on the hardware or operating system you are using, or on the way your company does business. Each tailoring procedure has a list of essential parameters; the essential parameters also appear on the list of all parameters. You can display the essential parameters only by using the selection filter. </p>
    <p>Many of the other (non-essential) parameters will have been pre-set with standard or default values. You can use these to "fine-tune" the way <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> works. </p>
    <p>You can mark parameters as essential, as a way of indicating that you may want to change them later, by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ing the <span class="field">Required </span><MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box.</p>
