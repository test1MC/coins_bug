    <h1 class="print">Memo Data</h1>
    <p>Memo data is a term given to information that you can store, by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.financial period" />, against each of the cost codes on a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />. A typical use of memo data would be to store budgets and forecasts that you want to use for comparison against actual figures for a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />. However, you can use memo data to store other types of information as well. Memo data allows you to store: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>cost figures for each cost category 
</li>
      <li>quantities 
</li>
      <li>hours 
</li>
      <li>revenue 
</li>
      <li>text notes </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can set up different types of memo data (for example, to represent different budgets), and configure whether you can update the data for closed cost periods. Some specific procedures within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> (for example, valuations and forecasts) also store information in memo data. </p>
    <p>You can enter memo data manually into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, or import it from a spreadsheet application, such as Excel. If you are using an estimating system, you can also copy that data into a spreadsheet, which you can then import into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. You can update budgets and forecasts by changing the values (unless auditing has been configured for a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Status budget, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> does not keep a record of the previous figures once they have been changed). You can then use the memo data for reporting purposes. Memo data is available to the <span class="Procedure"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Horizontal Report</span>, the configurable <span class="Procedure"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Status Report</span>, and to OA reports. </p>
    <p>You can control which memo data types individual users have access to, by setting memo data security. </p>
