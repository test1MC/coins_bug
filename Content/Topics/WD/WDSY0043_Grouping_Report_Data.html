    <h1 class="print">Report Writer - Grouping Report Data</h1>
    <p>Either when you set up the report initially, or afterwards, you can specify how the information will be grouped and sorted, and which subtotals will be shown. </p>
    <div class="process">
      <h2 class="print">To group the report data:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>While you are updating the report, click the Group tab.</li>
        <li>In the <span class="fIELD">Group By </span>column, select the field you want to group the report by. Records on which the value of this field are the same will be grouped together and sorted in the order you specify, and you can show totals for the group.</li>
        <li>In the <span class="field">Label </span>column, enter a label to show on the headers and footers (before and after each group).
<p class="noteheader">NOTE</p><div class="note"><p>Your system administrator may set up more detailed group headers (using <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBRLB">Default Report Labels</span>), which show, for example, a code and a description for each group.</p></div></li>
        <li>Choose whether to sort the group in ascending or descending order.</li>
        <li>Choose whether or not to display group headers (a label and the value of the group by field) before each group, and group footers (a label and the value of the group field, plus the totals of any totalled columns).</li>
        <li>If you want the report to start on a new page when the value of one of the fields changes (for example, to print information about different <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" /> on separate pages), use <span class="field">Page Level </span>to select the field.</li>
        <li>If you want to produce a summar<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed report based on details that you do not want to show, use <span class="field">Summary Level </span>to select the field to summar<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />e by.
<p> </p>
For example, if you want to produce a report on costs by section, you could produce a cost code report, but summar<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed by section. This would show the cost code totals for each section, but would not show the individual costs for each cost code.</li>
      </ol>
