        <h1 class="print">Moving Invoices to Another Batch</h1>
        <p>You can move PL invoices from an un-posted invoice entry batch to another un-posted invoice entry batch. This allows invoices that are not yet ready to be posted to be worked on later, without holding up the posting of invoices that are ready to post.</p>
        <p>Any scanned images associated with the invoice will also be transferred to the other batch.</p>
        <div class="process">
            <h2 class="print">To move invoices to another batch:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>

<p /><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> prompts you&#160;to enter the batch number of the batch the invoices are to be moved to. 
<p><img src="../../Resources/Images_P-R/PL/PL_021602.png" /></p>The lookup on the batch number field shows all un-posted invoice batches (except the batch the invoices are being moved from). 
<p />The invoices now appear in the batch you selected.</li>
