    <h1 class="print">Background</h1>
    <p>HM Revenue and Customs has a policy of moving taxpayers away from paper filing of tax returns to HMRC, and towards electronic filing. Starting with returns for the 2009/2010 tax year, all employers (subject to some minor exceptions which would not apply to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> clients) are compelled to complete their Payroll year-end submissions electronically.  Previously this only applied to employers with more than 50 employees in a single tax scheme.</p>
    <p>For some time now, it has been possible to file PAYE in-year movements for payroll <MadCap:variable name="Variables.leaver employee" />s and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr starter" />s (P45 and P46) electronically. From 6th April 2009, this has been compulsory for employers with over 50 employees; it is currently expected that this will become compulsory for smaller employers from 6th April 2011.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that all forms P45 and P46 for payroll <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr starter" />s and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.leaver employee" />s must now include the employee's date of birth and gender. This applies to the paper forms as well as to electronic submissions.</p>
    <p>General information about PAYE online filing obligations and facilities is available from the HMRC website at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/onlinefiling-understanding.htm" target="_blank">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/onlinefiling-understanding.htm</a>.<br /></p>
