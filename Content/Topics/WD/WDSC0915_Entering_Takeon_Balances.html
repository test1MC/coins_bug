    <h1 class="print">Creating a Subcontract Record - Entering Takeon Balances</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>After you have entered the subcontract record, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> asks if you want to <span class="screen type"><span class="screen type">Enter takeon balances.</span></span><p>If you are creating a record for a new subcontract, enter <strong>N. </strong></p></li>
      <li>If you are creating a new subcontract record for an existing subcontract (usually this only needs to be done when <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is first set up), you can take on cumulative to date balances. Enter <strong>Y.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays the Subcontract Takeon Balances transaction input screen (identical to the Certificate entry frame — see <a href="WDSC1011_Entering_Subcontractor_Certificates.html">Subcontractor Certificates - Entering Subcontractor Certificates</a>), with transaction number 000. <span class="screen type">Enter the Cert Date, Val'n Date, and Due Date </span>(these are for your information only). Enter the cumulative values to date for this subcontract. This will not generate any accounting transactions, and you do not need to post it.</p>
    <p>If you need to update fields that aren't normally available as input fields (for example Income Tax), go to <span class="function" title="Function:%WSCBSBS12">Subcontract Certificate Definition</span> and change the <span class="screen type">Up </span>(Update) flag for that line to<strong> Y</strong> (Remember to change it back afterwards).</p>
