    <p>
      <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />The instructions in this section provide information on how to modify OA online documentation with plus copy and/or user-defined menu books and topics, as well as how to add user-defined text to an existing topic.<br /></p>
    <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
    <div class="note">Throughout these instructions, you will be directed to refresh the treeview by right-clicking it and choosing "Refresh". It is a good rule to refresh the treeview in this way, regardless of the situation you are in: 
<ul><li>If you have previously expanded a menu on the treeview (before you create the plus copy), it will only pick up the original because it has already loaded the menu contents in the treeview. In this instance, you will always need to choose "Refresh" to get the plus copy.</li><li>If you have not yet expanded a menu on the treeview, and you create a plus copy of one of its children (either a topic or a menu), you will get the plus copy when you expand the menu in the treeview and click that child topic or menu. In this instance, it is not always necessary, but recommended nevertheless, to choose "Refresh" to get the plus copy.</li></ul></div>
