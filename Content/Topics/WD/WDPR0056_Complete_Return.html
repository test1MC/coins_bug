    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> validates that the data held within the Return is valid based on the current HMRC rules. Some examples of the type of error you may encounter are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Invalid Tax Codes<br /><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> validates the employee's tax code when you enter it, but the code might no longer be valid. An example of this would be a code with a suffix letter A, H, or J. These would have been valid when entered, but are no longer valid (assume HMRC haven?t sent you a new valid code for the employee).</li>
      <li>Negative SSP<br />If you overpaid SSP at the end of one tax year and then took it back at the start of the next year, you may end up with a negative SSP. This will fail validation.</li>
    </ul>
