        <h1 class="print">Attaching Batch Posting Reports</h1>
        <p>Posting reports are reports that can be run either before or after a batch is posted.&#160; If they are run before the batch is posted they are known as Listing Reports; if they are run after the batch is posted, they are known as Posting Reports, and show additional information, such as the number of the GL batch actually created.</p>
        <p>If the posting report is run for a batch from the past, the settings are taken from the current settings which may be different from when the batch was originally posted.&#160; This potentially leads to the situation where the newly-produced posting report is different to the original posting report.</p>
        <p>To avoid confusion, a batch posting report is automatically created at the time of posting, and <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can store the resulting PDF as an attachment to the batch.&#160; You can then recover and view the report without having to reproduce the posting report at a later stage.&#160;</p>
        <p>When you post GL journal batches, either manually or automatically, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> creates separate posting reports for each batch.&#160; For example, if you post a PL Manual Payment batch, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> creates and posts the <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.cash book" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span>and GL Journal batches automatically. As soon as the GL Journal Batch is posted, its posting report is also generated automatically, as are the posting reports of the source batches (that is, PLMAN and CBTR).&#160; All these posting reports are attached to the batches automatically.</p>
