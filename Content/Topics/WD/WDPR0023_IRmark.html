    <h1 class="print">Notes Re IRmark</h1>
    <p>Since 6th April 2009, the electronic messages sent to HMRC for PAYE in-year movements have needed to include a security feature known as the IRmark.  This has been a requirement for UK subcontractor CIS returns since April 2007. All <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> UK clients who also pay UK subcontractors and file CIS monthly returns electronically should, therefore, already have the IRmark technology working on their <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> server. However, before doing in-year filing for the first time, any client who is not also filing CIS returns should log a support call with the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> communication <MadCap:variable name="Variables.centre" /> so that the necessary arrangements can be made.</p>
    <p>As yet, there is no requirement to include the IRmark in end-of-year PAYE returns.</p>
    <p>Incorporation of the IRmark into the in-year returns has required a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> enhancement delivered as a software fix ? see <a href="WDPR0025_Install_Fixes.html">Install Fixes</a>.<br /></p>
