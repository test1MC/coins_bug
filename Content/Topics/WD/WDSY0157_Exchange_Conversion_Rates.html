        <ul>
            <li>Currency Exchange Rates are used for processing foreign currency transactions, unreal<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed and real<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed variances.</li>
            <li>Currency Conversion Rates are used for alternative base currency reporting in the <span class="module">General Ledger</span>. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you have <a href="WDSY0156_Currency_Codes.html">set up the currencies</a> you are using, enter the exchange rates between your base currency and the other currencies.&#160; You need to update these on a regular basis.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <p>Determine what your procedures will be for setting your exchange rates. These can be varied at intervals ranging from every day, to annual. Different periods can be used for different rates.</p>
        <p>Determine what your source will be for the rate. Typical sources are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>As advised by head office.</li>
            <li>Taken from the daily newspaper.</li>
            <li>Taken from a website such as <a href="http://www.oanda.com/" target="_blank">www.oanda.com</a>.<br /></li>

<p />Exchange rates and conversion rates are effective from the date indicated against them until another rate is entered with a later date. </li>

                    <li>Enter of the rates to the maximum number of decimal positions (typically six), if possible. This will avoid conversion penny/cent differences as much as is possible with currencies such as GBP, USD, EUR which have the normal two places of decimals. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will handle these correctly but it can be inconvenient to have a large number of one penny/cent transactions posted to the currency rounding account.</li>
