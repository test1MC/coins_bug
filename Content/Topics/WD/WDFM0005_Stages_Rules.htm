        <p>Stage rules enable you to select the which stage must be completed before another, to record one step before another and to enable you to maintain a simple workflow of the tasks.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>A list of stages which disallow the current stage.<br /><br />This tab will refer to all the stages that cannot and should not be used. A list of all available stages is shown.</p>
                    <p>Select the stages that are to be disallowed for this stage. For example you cannot “Confirm All Tasks Complete” for the job if you have not allocated the tasks to an <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" />.</p>
                    <p>Careful consideration is required for these stages and these may also vary depending on the contract.<br /><br /></p>

                <li>
                    <p>A list of stages which are completed by the current stage.<br /><br />This tab enables you to select the stages that will have been completed by the current stage. For example you would complete the “Add Job” stage if you are allocating a task.<br /><br /></p>

                <li>
                    <p>A list of stages which are cancelled by the current stage.<br /><br />You can select the stages that are cancelled by using or selecting the current stage. For example Close Job or Cancel Job can be cancelled by Reallocate Task.<br /><br /></p>

                <li>
                    <p>A list of stages which are required before the current stage.<br /><br />You would select the stages that are required to be done before you reach the current stage. For example to add a task would be required before you can approve the task.<br /><br /></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
