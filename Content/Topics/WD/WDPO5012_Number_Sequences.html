        <h1 class="print">Number Sequences</h1>
        <p>You can change the next sequence number for any of the purchase order numbers, subcontract order numbers, requisition numbers or subcontract instruction numbers. You would normally only need to use this if you are moving from another system and want to use the same sequence number formats. </p>
        <div class="process">
            <h2 class="print">To change sequence numbers:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to the relevant "PO Sequences" function.
<p class="noteheader">NOTE</p><div class="note">The function parameters to the procedure determine which group of sequence numbers you can maintain.&#160;</div><p>This is a standard line-based maintenance procedure. Each line shows a different prefix and the next sequence number for that prefix.</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images_P-R/Procurement/PO_501201.png" class="HalfWidth" /><br /></p></li>
                <li>To change a sequence number, open the line and enter the new number.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
            <div class="note">The <span class="field">Next Number </span>is the next number that <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will put into a temporary storage area. This acts as a 'pool' of available sequence numbers. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> uses this pool to ensure that sequence numbers are not lost if, for example, a user creates an order and then deletes it. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> tops up this pool when the number of available sequence numbers drops below a pre-defined level. Thus the next sequence number may not be the same as the number shown here, because it is taken from the pool.&#160;</div>
