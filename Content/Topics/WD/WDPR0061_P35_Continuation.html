    <p>You are not required to submit the paper based P35 Continuation, but it has been retained for use as an aid to reconciliation.</p>
    <p>More columns have been added to the P35, so that the Reconciliation Totals page is now redundant (and has therefore been removed), as these values appear as column totals.</p>
