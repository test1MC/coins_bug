    <p>Before using the <span class="module">Payroll</span> module, there are a number of steps that should be performed initially to set it up in effective working order. Step 7 is outlined below.</p>
    <p>After you have performed these initial steps, you are ready to process Payroll (see <a href="WDPR0004_Processing_Payroll.html">Processing Payroll</a>).</p>

      <p>In <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBCRTHR0">Lookup Codes</span>, these simple two-field files are shared by both <span class="module">Human Resources </span>and <span class="module">Payroll</span>. Many fields are reserved for use in HR, but some are used in conjunction with US <span class="module">Payroll </span>processing. These fields are required to be completed in <span class="function" title="Function:%WP69200BEMP">Employee Maintenance</span>, but if an organ<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation chooses not to use a particular field, a blank record can be created in the Lookup Code that will be the primary default.</p>

Earning categories summar<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />e the types of pay into categories that can then be reported on. They also allow for different methods, such as Amount, or different multipliers for Overtime and Double Time. If any earning category is made dormant, it cannot be used in Payroll processing.</li>
        <li>In <span class="function" title="Function:%WPR218BSTE">Skill Levels</span>, add skill levels. Skill levels are used with Union and Trade rates and calculations. Skill levels must first be created here before they may be referenced in other files and on a timecard.</li>
        <li>In <span class="function" title="Function:%WPR220BQRU"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr unions" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span>, add unions, union calculations, and union rates for any Collective Bargaining Agreements to which you are a signatory.</li>
