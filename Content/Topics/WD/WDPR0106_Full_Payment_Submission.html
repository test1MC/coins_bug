    <h1 class="print">Full Payment Submission</h1>
    <p>A Full Payment Submission (FPS) informs HMRC how much you have paid employees, and what deductions, if any, you have made for PAYE tax and National Insurance contributions.  You must make a Full Payment Submission whenever employees are paid. As such an FPS will be required for each PAYE scheme on each <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> payroll each period, except when no employees are being paid in that period, so FPSs will be <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> and period type specific returns.</p>
    <p>You can submit more than one FPS return per payroll per PAYE scheme per period to cater for situations where some employees are paid before others within the same payroll period. The employees that are included in an FPS return are identified by their payment records (created during pay calculation); these are marked with the FPS return number when the FPS is submitted to avoid picking them up twice.</p>
    <p class="noteheader">IMPORTANT NOTE</p>
    <div class="note">It will not be possible to create an FPS before there are employees who have reached the ACCEPTED status, and an FPS must be sent for all payments before you will be allowed to move into the following period or post the costing batch. You can create the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.eft" /> file and submit the FPS in either order.</div>

      <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
      <div class="note">The Full Payment Submission can be made from the period-specific HMRC Workbenches, or from the "global" HMRC Workbench.  If you use the global workbench, you will need to select the pay frequency.</div>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to the HMRC Workbench for the appropriate pay frequency (weekly, monthly, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.2-weekly" /> or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.4-weekly" />).</li>
        <li>If there is more than one PAYE scheme for this pay frequency, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays a list of schemes. Click the link for the PAYE scheme.</li>
        <li>On the RTI tab, select the <span class="field">Return Type </span>"FPS - Full Payment Submission" and click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/add.svg" class="button" />.</li>
        <li>The <span class="field">Year</span> field defaults to the current year; leave this as the default (unless you are submitting a return for the previous year and the date is on or before 19th April).</li>
        <li>Set the <span class="field">Type </span>to <span class="userselect">Live </span>(or to <span class="userselect">Test </span>when testing).</li>
        <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/save.svg" class="button" />.</li>
        <li>From the Workbench browse screen, select the submission record you have just created.</li>
        <li>From the Choose Action list, select <span class="userselect">Submit </span>and click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/actiongo.svg" class="button" />.
<p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> validates the data first. The XML file will only be created and the data sent if the data passes the validation.</p></li>
