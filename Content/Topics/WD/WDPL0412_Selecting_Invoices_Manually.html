        <div class="note">If you select an invoice containing a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour" /> element, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> may not allow payment if the subcontractor does not meet certain requirements (see the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <a href="WDSC0730_Subcontractor_Warning_Messages.html">SC Ledger Basics - Subcontractor Warning Messages</a> for details).&#160;</div>
