        <h1 class="print">Example of a Certificate Definition - Percentage Line</h1>
        <p>Suppose retention is calculated as 5% of the Total Cost amount. The Retention line looks like this:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images_S-U/SC/SC_022301.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The retention calculation is based on the Total Cost line (line 200), so the <span class="field">Subtotals</span> line is +200.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The user is to be able to override the retention, so the <span class="field">Update</span> field is <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Retention is to be held in a retention account, so the code for that <span class="module">General Ledger</span>account is entered in the <span class="field">Account</span>field.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To display values such as retention as negative values, create a display line that subtracts the retention line from a blank line.</p>
