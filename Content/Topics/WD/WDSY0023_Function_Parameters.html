    <h1 class="print">Function Parameters</h1>
    <p>Many programs within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can be set up to run in different ways. Function parameters (also called menu parameters) determine how the program runs. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The same order entry program is used for entering material orders and subcontract orders, and for site orders and head office orders. So: 
<p>po101.p with parameters (MATERIAL,C,A,B,M,N,H) = Enter head office material order, </p><p>but </p><p>po101.p with parameters (TRADE,F,C,C,,N,S) = Enter site subcontract order </p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You need to set up a different function for each different way you want the program to run; in fact most of the commonly required functions are already provided as standard. </p>
    <p>You can allocate functions to users (see <a href="WDSY0017_How_Function_Access_Works.html">How Function Access Works</a>) to control exactly which users can run which routines (for example, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Browse can be made available to many users while full <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Maintenance is made available only to a limited number of trained users). </p>
