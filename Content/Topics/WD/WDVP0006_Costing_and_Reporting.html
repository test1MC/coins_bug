    <h2>
      <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Status</h2>
    <p>With either method of controlling subcontract variation orders and payments, it is possible to highlight all such variations in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> cost records by use of one or more separate cost categories.  </p>
    <p>For example, if a normal plumbing subcontract cost is costed to 5170.SC (Plumbing Subcontract) then a variation can be costed to 5170.US (Plumbing Unbudgeted Subcontract).  This allows the full plumbing cost to be seen by looking at all cost categories for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost head" /> 5170 while allowing variations to be separately identified by the cost category.</p>
    <h2>
      <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR" />
    </h2>
    <p>With Method 1 for controlling subcontract variation orders and payments (that is, without use of variation orders), the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cv cvr" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> can only show certified variations.</p>
    <p>With Method 2 or 3 for controlling subcontract variation orders and payments (that is, using variation orders), the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cv cvr" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> can show committed variations as well as certified variations.</p>
    <p>A <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cv cvr" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> view can be configured listing Subcontract Orders with the original value, total variation value and current value for each order. It can also show the certified amounts for variations separated out provided that a different certificate line has been used for variation payment stages.</p>
    <p>A <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cv cvr" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> view can also be configured to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.analyse" /> actual and committed costs by cost category - thus identifying variations separately.<br /></p>
