    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can be run both at head office and on site, with different locations all having access to the same information. This means, for example, that an order can be raised on site and approved (committed) at head office. </p>
    <p>There are some differences in processing between head office orders and site orders (for example, the gains and losses sheet does not appear for site orders), but in most respects they appear the same, so this manual does not distinguish between them. <br /></p>
