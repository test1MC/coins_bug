      <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS2014BHEV">Cancellation Workbench Events</span> allows you to set up the events you can run for a cancellation.  These might include recording a cash transaction, notifiying solicitors or closing the cancellation record.</p>
    <div class="process">
      <h2 class="print">To set up cancellation events:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS2014BHEV">Cancellation Workbench Events</span>.</li>
        <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/add.svg" class="button" /> to add a new event.</li>
        <li>Enter a code for the new event.</li>
        <li>If the event is one that is not run manually from the <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS1070SHCA">Cancellations Workbench</span> but is run automatically by a process like sending a letter, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /><span class="field">System Generated</span>.</li>
        <li>Select the system event. This determines the type of event you are setting up. There are four types of event: 
<ul><li><span class="userselect">CASH </span>- allows you to record cash transactions (such as refund of deposit).</li><li><span class="userselect">RETAIN </span>- allows you to record that you have retained part of the deposit.</li><li><span class="userselect">CLOSE </span>- closes the cancellation file (you can filter out closed cancellations).</li><li><span class="userselect">MEMO </span>- allows you to record additional information about the cancellation.</li></ul></li>
        <li>Enter a full description for the event. (The short description is only used in <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/COINSplus.flsnp" />.)</li>
        <li>If you want to allow users to run the event more than once, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /><span class="field">Allow Duplicates</span>.</li>
        <li>If you only want to allow the event to be run if other specified events have already been run, enter the codes for those events in the <span class="field">Previous Events </span>field. </li>
        <li>If you want to prevent the event if other specified events have already been run, enter the codes for those events in the <span class="field">Stop Events </span>field. </li>
        <li>To restrict how many days before or after today users can enter for the date of the event, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the <span class="field">Restrict Backdating </span>or <span class="field">Restrict Forward Dating </span>field (or both), and enter the number of days. For example, to stop users entering a date more than two days before today, set <span class="field">Allowable Days Backdating</span> to <span class="userinput">2</span>. If both are set to <span class="userinput">0</span>, users will be forced to enter today's date. </li>
        <li>Enter the default comments; this is the text that will appear in the <span class="field">Comments</span> field when the event is run (the user can enter different text if they want).</li>
        <li>If you want to update captions when the event is run, select the caption groups to update.</li>
        <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/save.svg" class="button" />.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="configuration">

      <p>To copy the comments for the event to the Notes automatically, enter the event code as one of the values of the HS parameter <span class="parameter">COMNTVIS</span>.</p>
