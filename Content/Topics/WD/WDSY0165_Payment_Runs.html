    <h1 class="print">Multi-Currency Payment Runs</h1>
    <p>In <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, if you are making payments in more than one currency, you must create separate payment batches for each currency.</p>
    <div class="process">
      <h2 class="print">To process payments:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Run the Select/Deselect procedure to select the transactions to be paid. If you use the automatic (batch) selection, you must create separate payment batches for each currency.</li>
        <li>Freeze the payment batch(es). If you use sector-based ledgers or have selected transactions of more than one currency, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays a list of the batches, showing the currency. Select the batch you want to freeze.</li>
        <li>Make the payments. If you have frozen more than one batch - for example batches in different currencies - you must select the batch you want to process. If you are printing <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" />, make sure your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> stationery matches the bank account you have selected.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can only process automatic payments in different currencies if you have bank accounts set up in the relevant currencies. If you do not have an account in the relevant currency, pay the transactions using <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.cash book" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span>, and allocate payments to the transactions manually.<br /></p>
