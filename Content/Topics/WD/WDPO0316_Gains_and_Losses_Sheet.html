    <h1 class="print">Gains and Losses Sheet</h1>
    <p>If you are entering a head office <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" />, material or subcontract order, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> may prompt you to complete the Gains and Losses sheet. </p>
    <p>The Gains and Losses sheet (also called "letting sheet") allows you to record and compare prices negotiated by buyers against those used in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tender" /> by estimators. It is not designed to be a measure of profitability on a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />. </p>
    <p>When you have completed the Gains &amp; Losses sheet, click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/forward.svg" class="button" /> . <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> calculates the saving or loss on an item-by-item basis, and for the whole order. </p>
    <p>To report on the Gains and Losses, go to the <span class="function" title="Function:%WPO3140RPOH">Order Placing Schedule</span> report. <br /></p>
