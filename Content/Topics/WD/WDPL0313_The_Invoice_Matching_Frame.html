        <h1 class="print">The Invoice Matching Frame</h1>
        <p>The Invoice Matching tab allows you to identify which items on the order are covered by the invoice.</p>

        <p><strong>If the order required GRNs: </strong>
        </p>
        <p>The list shows all unmatched GRNs for the order.</p>
        <p>If a GRN line has been fully invoiced, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> in the <span class="field">Comp </span>column.</p>
        <p>The <span class="field">Delivered </span>columns show the quantity and value delivered according to the GRN(s).</p>
        <p>The <span class="field">Invoiced</span> columns are for you to enter the amounts for which you have been invoiced. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> assumes that the invoice includes GRNs dated on or before the invoice date, and fills in the <span class="field">Invoiced </span>column for these GRNs from the figures in the <span class="field">Delivered</span> column (in other words, what should have been invoiced).</p>
        <p>The <span class="field">Invoice Amount </span>is the actual total amount of the invoice.</p>
        <p>The <span class="field">Matched</span> amount is the total of the values in the <span class="field">Invoiced </span>column.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><strong>If the order did not require GRNs: </strong>
        </p>
        <p>The list shows any outstanding order details.</p>
        <p>If an order line has been fully invoiced, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> in the <span class="field">Comp </span>column.</p>
        <p>The <span class="field">Outstanding</span> columns show the outstanding quantity and value on the order.</p>
        <p>The <span class="field">Invoiced</span> columns are for you to enter the amounts for which you have been invoiced. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> fills in the <span class="field">Invoiced</span> column from the figures in the <span class="field">Delivered</span> column (in other words, what should have been invoiced).</p>
        <p>The <span class="field">Invoice Amount </span>is the actual total amount of the invoice.</p>
        <p>The <span class="field">Matched</span> amount is the total of the values in the <span class="field">Invoiced </span>column.</p>
        <p>You can add lines for additional charges. </p>
