    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> provides special fields that allow you to print the value of the order in words. These fields use the appropriate wording for the currency (for example, Dollars and Cents or Pounds and Pence).</p>
    <div class="process">
      <h2 class="print">To print the order value in words</h2>
      <p>On the purchase order document, add one of the following fields:</p>

        <li>
          <span class="fieldname">RO_poh_famount_words</span> - The total order amount in the order currency, in words</li>

      <p>The following fields are also available for printing the value of an order line in words:</p>
