    <h1 class="print">Setting Up Desktop Features</h1>
    <p>The <a href="WDUG0094_COINS_Desktop.html"><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Desktop</a> gives users a custom<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />able screen from which they can run a selection of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> functions. This page explains how to set up various features that are available on users' desktops.</p>

      <h2 class="print">Tile Values</h2>
      <p>Some <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> functions have been enhanced to allow you to show certain values on the tile. You can use <span class="function" title="Function:%WSY1260BSXC">Desktop Tile Values</span> to set up calculations that will provide additional values. For more information, see <a href="WDSY0185_Desktop_Tile_Values.html">Desktop Tile Values</a>. </p>
      <h2>Tile Options</h2>
      <p>You can set up alternative <MadCap:variable name="Variables.behaviour" /> for the links on <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Desktop tiles (for example, to open a specific tab or a named filter). These are then available as options that the user can select when configuring the tile. Use <span class="function" title="Function:%WSY1270BSXC">Desktop Tile Options</span> to set up these options.</p>
      <h2>Global Search</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="WDUG0101_Global_Search.html">Global Search</a> allows users to search for records in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> database (for example, suppliers, customers, subcontractors or contracts), and also to find and run <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> functions. The search is configurable, so you can choose which tables, and which fields on those tables, to include in the search. See <a href="WDSY0186_Global_Search_Configuration.html">Global Search Configuration</a>.</p>
      <h2>Desktop Images</h2>
      <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Desktop features a background image (which each user can choose from a list of available images) and an account image (such as a photograph of the user). Two separate functions allow you to load the images to your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> system:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="function" title="Function:%WSY1160HXXX">Background Images</span> allows you to load images that can be used as the desktop background. Individual users can then select one of these to use on their desktop. The file name you give to the file is used in the <span class="field" data-mce-mark="1">Background Image </span>selection list in <span class="function" title="Function:%WSYBSUR">Users</span>. The images are saved in the <span class="wrap" data-mce-mark="1">$BASE/ custimage/bg/</span> directory. Standard images, provided in the <span class="wrap" data-mce-mark="1">$BASE/ images/bg/</span> directory, are also available to users.</li>
        <li>
          <span class="function" title="Function:%WSY1170HXXX">User Images</span> allows you to load the images that are used as the account picture on each user's desktop. The image files must be JPG format files, and should be approximately 60px square. (You can use larger images but the browser will resize them, which does not always produce good results.) You must name the files <span class="userinput" data-mce-mark="1">&lt;userid&gt;.jpg</span> (for example, for a user whose user ID is JSMITH, the file would be <span class="userinput" data-mce-mark="1">jsmith.jpg</span>. The images are saved in the <span class="wrap" data-mce-mark="1">$BASE/ custimage/ sysuser/</span> directory.
<p>If there is no file for a user, the account image will be the image from the user’s <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> HR record if one exists, otherwise it will be a silhouette image. </p></li>
      </ul>
