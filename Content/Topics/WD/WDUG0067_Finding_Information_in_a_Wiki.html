        <h1 class="print">Finding Information in a Wiki</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />A Wiki site is divided in to a number of webs; each one representing an area of collaboration.&#160; Each web is made up of a collection of hyperlinked pages (or 'topics').</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To browse a Wiki web, just click one of the highlighted links. </li>
            <li>You can navigate to different webs using the combo in the upper right corner of each topic.&#160; Individual topics are identified using topic names called <a href="WDUG0076_WikiWords.html">WikiWords</a>: these usually consist of two or more words with initial capital letters and no spaces. If you know the WikiWord for a topic you can jump straight to it using the jump to field in the upper right corner of each topic. The Web home page of each Web is the WebHome topic.&#160; 
</li>
            <li>The "breadcrumbs" at the top of each topic show you the topics above the one you're looking at; you can click any of the links to go to the relevant topic.

            <li>You can also search for topics using the search page.&#160; Click the search button <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/detail.svg" class="button" /> at the bottom of the page.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="process">
            <h2 class="print">To search a Wiki:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/detail.svg" class="button" /> button.</li>
                <li>In the search page, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the boxes for the Wiki Webs you want to look in.&#160; For example, if you are only interested in information from a "Projects" Wiki, just <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the box next to <span class="field" data-mce-mark="1">Projects</span>.</li>
                <li>In the <span class="field" data-mce-mark="1">Words </span>field, enter the word or words you want to search for.
<p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will find topics that contain all the words you enter, in any order.&#160; For example, if you search for project future bridge, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will find topics that contain the words "bridge" AND "future" AND "project", but not topics that only contain "future" and "project" but not "bridge".</p><p>Also, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will only find the whole word, so if you search for bridge, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will not find topics that only contain words like "bridges" and "bridgebuilding", but not the word "bridge".&#160; However, the case of the word is not important: <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> would find topics containing "bridge", "Bridge" or "BRIDGE".</p></li>
                <li><MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> the <span class="field" data-mce-mark="1">Live </span>box if you only want to search the most recent version of each topic.&#160; If you want to include previous versions of topics in the search, clear the <span class="field" data-mce-mark="1">Live </span>box.</li>
                <li>If you want to search for topics according to when they were updated, enter a range of dates.&#160; For example, you could leave the <span class="field" data-mce-mark="1">Words </span>field blank, and enter a date to find any topics that have been modified since that date.&#160;</li>
                <li>Click <span class="key" data-mce-mark="1">Search</span>.
<p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> lists the topics that match your search.</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images_S-U/UG_006702.gif" /></p></li>
                <li>Click a link in the <span class="field" data-mce-mark="1">Abstract </span>column to display the topic.</li>
