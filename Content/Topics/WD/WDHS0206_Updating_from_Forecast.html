    <h1 class="print">Updating Progress from the Forecast</h1>
    <p>
      <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS1332BHFC">Progress from Forecast</span> is one of three ways to update the construction progress in the <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS1330BVSI">Construction Workbench</span> (the other two being the <a href="WDHS0204_Progress_Tick_Sheet.html">Progress <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Sheet</a> and <a href="WDHS0207_Updating_by_Construction_Stage.html">Progress Update</a> screens).</p>
    <p>The construction stages are shown in the order in which they are forecast to be completed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the construction has gone according to the forecast, you can quickly update the actual progress by confirming the forecast dates.  </li>
      <li>If some stages were completed behind (or ahead of) schedule, you can enter the actual completion date.  </li>
      <li>If some stages have not yet been completed, you can revise the forecast for those stages.</li>
    </ul>
