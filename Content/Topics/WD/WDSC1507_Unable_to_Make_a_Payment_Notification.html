        <h1 class="print">If You Are Unable to Make a Payment Notification</h1>
        <p>If the Revenue systems are down or the facility to communicate with Revenue systems is unavailable due to circumstances beyond your control, you are allowed to make the payments but must notify Revenue as soon as possible afterwards.&#160;</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> provides an override facility to print <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" /> and remittances, and create a&#160;<MadCap:variable name="Variables.eft" /> file which includes transactions not author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed by Revenue.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First, contact Revenue to check whether the circumstances justify use of the override.</li>
            <li>Contact the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> support desk and request them to apply the override.&#160;</li>
            <li>After printing the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" /> or generating the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.eft" /> file, do not post the payment batch.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you have done this you need to run the Notify Payments process as soon as you are able.&#160; This is known as "post-payment notification".</p>
        <div class="process">
