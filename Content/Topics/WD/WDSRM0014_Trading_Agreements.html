        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Trading agreements provide a method of coordinating and controlling supply chain policies.&#160; They are designed to control the raising of purchase orders for a specific commodity or trade, and provide retrospective monitoring of non-compliance within these agreements.&#160; You can <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquire" /> on non-compliant order lines using the Non-Compliance subtab on the Trading Agreements tab in <span class="function" title="Function:%WCI1030SXXX">SRM Workbench</span>.</p>
        <p>You can set up agreements either to warn of breaches, or prevent breaches at point of order. For example, if you decide that Vodafone is your sole mobile phone <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" />, you can have a restricted agreement set up against the mobile phone commodity code for Vodafone; this would prevent orders from being raised against other <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" />. However, if you decide that Vodafone is your recommended <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" />, but you still want to allow mobile phone orders to be raised against other <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" />, you would have a recommended agreement. </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> provides the facility for agreements with up to five levels of detail (from group-wide down to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> level).&#160; When someone raises an order line for a commodity or trade for which an agreement exists, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> checks whether there is an agreement for the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />, then for the branch, and so on up to the general (group-wide) level.&#160; <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> applies the lowest-level agreement that exists, and prevents the line, warns that there is an agreement, or allows the line, depending on the rule that applies for that agreement.</p>

        <h2>Non-compliance</h2>
        <p>If you allow orders that are in breach of a trading agreement (whether or not <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> warns about them), <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> records any order lines that breach an agreement as being non-compliant.&#160; You can <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquire" /> on any non-compliant lines: on the <span class="function" title="Function:%WCI1030SXXX">SRM Workbench</span> Trading Agreements tab, the Non-Compliance tabs show any order lines that are in breach of a current trading agreement, and you can dig deeper to show the details of the order.</p>

                <li>If relevant at that level, select the company, region or branch to which the agreement level applies.</li>

            <p>You need to set up the rules that can apply to trading agreements, using <span class="function" title="Function:%WTI1510BSTE">Trading Agreement Rules</span>.</p>
            <p>You can set up trading agreements at any of five levels: Group (that is, across <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" />), <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" style="text-transform: capitalize;" />, "Region", "Branch" and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" />.&#160; The two levels above <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> are configurable, and relate to the "buying region" and "branch" that are set up using JC parameters <span class="parameter">JOBREG </span>and <span class="parameter">JOBBR</span>.&#160; These denote which fields on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> record <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> uses to identify the region and branch a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> belongs to.</p>
            <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
            <div class="note">Trading agreements apply to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />-related orders (material, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" /> and subcontract) and also to overhead orders - though overhead orders cannot reference regional and branch agreements).</div>
            <p>The field that identifies "region" would normally be the same across all <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" />.&#160; However, you could use different fields in different <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" />, and set <span class="parameter">JC/JOBREG </span>as a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />-specific parameter.&#160; If a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> does not have the concept of region, leave <span class="parameter">JC/JOBREG </span>blank for that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />.&#160;&#160;The same applies to "branch".</p>
            <p>The SRM parameter <span class="parameter">TASCOPLB </span>allows you to set the labels to use in <span class="module">SRM</span> for the "region" and "branch" entities.&#160;</p>
