      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> System Guide</h1>
    <p>This section of the online documentation covers information relevant to setting up and managing a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> system, such as security; setting up users, functions and menus; setting up faxing and imaging.</p>
    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> documentation assumes that there are two types of people using <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>System Administrator</strong> is the person who has access to the SYSAdmin User ID. This may in fact be more than one person. Because the SYSAdmin User ID allows access to all parts of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> system, and gives extensive system privileges, only responsible people with a good understanding of the workings of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> should be allowed access to it.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Users</strong> are all the other people who use <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. Each may have access to different parts of the system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Within your company, the responsibilities of System Administrator must be assigned, either to one System Administrator, or to several people with access to the SYSAdmin User ID.</p>
