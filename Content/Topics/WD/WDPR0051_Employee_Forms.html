        <h1 class="print">Employee Forms</h1>
        <p>
            <br />The Employee EOY form can be one of four types: <strong>P14</strong>, <strong>P38S</strong>, <strong>P38A</strong>, or <strong>NONE</strong>.&#160;By default, the form will be a P14.&#160;If this is inappropriate, you can change it using the <span class="key">F7</span> Form Type option.</p>
        <p>The <strong>NONE</strong> option allows you to exclude employees who have transferred to a different pay frequency within the same Tax Scheme.&#160;<strong>Note:</strong> If the employee was transferred using the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> routine, this will not be required.</p>

        <p>If you return on an employee, you will be allowed to see their form and, if appropriate, update the content.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="key">F11</span> will take you to Employee Maintenance for the selected employee.</li>
            <li><span class="key">F12</span> will take you to NI Details Maintenance for the selected employee.</li>
