    <p>The Auto-<MadCap:variable name="Variables.enrolment" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Report details pension contributions and allows you to check if pension contributions are meeting your targets in terms of percentage of qualifying earnings.</p>
    <p>The report shows auto-<MadCap:variable name="Variables.enrolment" /> information ? employee pension status, contributions (ER,EE) for date range.</p>
    <p>The report allows comparison of contributions to a percentage of auto-<MadCap:variable name="Variables.enrolment" /> qualifying earning, so you can check you have complied or met your own targets. You can filter by the EE, ER or Combined contribution falling below specified percentages. </p>
    <h2>Register Information Report</h2>
    <p>The Register Information Report shows registration information by PAYE scheme and categorises the employees who were employed at the staging date. It shows, by pension scheme, how many have been auto-enrolled, and how many are existing members. It also shows - for the whole PAYE scheme - how many employees are in a DB/Hybrid transition, and how many employees in the scheme have not been counted in the other categories above.</p>
