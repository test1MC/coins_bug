      <span class="module">General Ledger</span> allows transactions to be posted to two <MadCap:variable name="Variables.financial years" /> (24 or 26 periods, depending on how many periods per year are being used). To move the available periods for several <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" /> forward by 12 months, run <span class="function" title="Function:%WGL2012BGLPYE">GL Year End (Cross-<MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" style="text-transform: capitalize;" />)</span> (not necessarily at the end of a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.financial year" />; in fact it is more likely to be run mid-year). The procedure does not delete any information, it changes the current year on the GL configuration record. You have the option to carry budgets over to the new open year.</p>
    <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
    <div class="note">Once you close a year (that is, move the periods on), you can no longer post to it; you can only report on it.</div>
    <p>You can select the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" /> for which the year-end is to be run; <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will submit separate year-end runs for each <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />.</p>
