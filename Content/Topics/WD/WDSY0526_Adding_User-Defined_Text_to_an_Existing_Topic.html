    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> provides a screen that shows help text for each function and the fields on that function. In addition to the text that is provided with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, you can add your own help text for functions and individual fields. This allows you to enhance the help to address the needs of your users, or to provide help for user-defined fields such as analysis sets. This "user text" is displayed with a different <MadCap:variable name="Variables.colour" />ed background, to differentiate it from the standard <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> help text (you can modify the appearance of the user text). User text will not be overwritten when you upgrade <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
    <p>For instructions on how to provide your own help text for a field or function, please refer to <a href="WDSY0033_Customising_Help_Text.html">Custom<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ing Help Text</a> on the OA Online Documentation Menu.</p>
