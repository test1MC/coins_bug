    <p>If you are unable to fulfil a request, or if there are problems with the request, you might discuss with the person who made the request and decide to return it to them.  The request will then appear on that person's <a href="WDPC0007_Your_Requests.html">Previous Requests</a> list with a comment from you, and they can create a new request by copying and amending details from the returned request.</p>
    <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
    <div class="note">You can only return a request if all lines are "Awaiting attention"; that is, if no-one has begun to process the request.</div>
