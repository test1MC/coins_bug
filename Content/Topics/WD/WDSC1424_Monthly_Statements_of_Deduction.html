        <h1 class="print">Monthly Statements of Deduction</h1>
        <p>Under this method, you send subcontractors a single statement for each tax month. </p>
        <p>Before you produce the statements of deduction for a month, you must run the month end process, which generates the records used on the statements (see <a href="WDSC1415_Processing_Returns.html">Processing Returns</a>).&#160; You can produce the statements before or after you have submitted the return.</p>
        <p>You must provide the statement by the 19th of the month. </p>

        </p>
        <p>You can produce the statements as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fax the document to the subcontractor, if the subcontractor has agreed to this method: use <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC7530FAX">Fax Statements of Deduction</span> and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /><span class="field">Fax</span> on the output options tab.</li>
            <li>Email the PDF of the document directly to the subcontractor, if the subcontractor has agreed to this method: use <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC7530EMAIL">Email Statements of Deduction</span> and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /><span class="field">Email</span> on the output options tab.</li>
            <li>Print the document and post it to the subcontractor: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>use <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC7530FSCN">Print Statements of Deduction</span> to print statements for all subcontractors.</li>
                <li>use <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC7530PRINT">Print Other Statements of Deduction</span> to print statements for only those subcontractors without a fax number or email address, or who have specifically been set up to receive printed statements.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
