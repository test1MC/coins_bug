        <p>Processing an audit (also called "creating an audit") assigns the next audit number to a set of audit records (that is, records of changes). You should process audits regularly. When you generate audit reports, you can choose to report on an individual audit. </p>
        <div class="process">
            <h2 class="print">To process an audit:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>From the Audit - Processing menu in the relevant module, select the option for the table for which you want to process an audit. </li>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays the name of the file that will be audited, and the audit number that will be assigned to it. </p>
                <li>To process the audit, click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/save.svg" class="button" />. </li>
            </ol>
            <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> produces a report that shows the results of the audit processing. </p>
            <p>Once you have created an audit, you should produce an audit report, using the relevant Audit Report function.</p>
