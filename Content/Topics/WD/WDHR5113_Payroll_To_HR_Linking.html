    <h1 class="print" MadCap:autonum="1 ">Payroll To HR Linking</h1>
    <p>Linking from Payroll to HR can be via the <span class="function">Payroll Requests Workbench</span> in HR or it can be direct.</p>
    <p>Payroll to HR linking via the <span class="function">Payroll Requests Workbench</span> is very similar to <a href="WDHR5112_HR_To_Payroll_Linking_Via_A_Workbench.html">HR To Payroll Linking Via A Workbench</a>, just in the opposite direction. The <span class="function">Payroll Requests Workbench</span> screen is the same as the <span class="function">HR Requests Workbench</span>, except that it also displays the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> and period type for the linked Payroll employee and shows the HR ID instead of the employee number. 
</p>
    <p>Direct Payroll to HR linking can be used to effectively bypass the workbench stage, though if you are using HR to Payroll workbench linking it is not recommended to use direct Payroll to HR linking for the same type of value as this could lead to changes made in HR (with an associated request waiting on the <span class="function">HR Requests Workbench</span>) being wiped out (which will delete the request) before anyone in Payroll has noticed the change. 
</p>
    <p>For benefits, Payroll changes will only link to HR if the HR person already has an appropriate benefit (that is, it will not add a new one).</p>
