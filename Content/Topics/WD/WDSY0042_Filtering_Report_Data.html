    <h1 class="print">Report Writer - Filtering Report Data</h1>
Either when you set up the report initially, or afterwards, you can specify filters to control which information is included in the report.

    <div class="process"><h2 class="print">To filter the report data:</h2><ol><li>While you are updating the report, click the Filter tab.</li><li>Choose the first field you want to evaluate to decide whether to include the record on the report.</li><li>Choose how you want to evaluate the field (for example, whether to include records where the field equals something, or doesn't equal something).</li><li>Type the value you want to compare the field with.
<p>For example, to include only <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" /> in London, select <span class="userinput"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Location </span>from the Filter list, select <span class="userinput">Equals </span>from the comparison list, and type <span class="userinput">London </span>in the value field.</p><p>If you choose <span class="userinput">Matches </span>from the comparison list, you can use a can-do list in the value field. So for example to include only cost codes that end with 99, select <span class="userinput">Cost Code </span>from the Filter list, select <span class="userinput">Matches </span>from the comparison list, and type <span class="userinput">*99</span> in the <span class="field">Value </span>field.</p></li><li>Repeat the process for other fields you want to filter on. Note that the filters are 'AND' filters; so for example if you specify <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" /> where <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Location equals London, and where <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /><MadCap:variable name="Variables.hr manager" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> equals John Smith, the report will only include <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" /> in London that are managed by John Smith.</li></ol></div></body>
