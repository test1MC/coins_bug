    <h1 class="print">Copies To Tab</h1>
    <p>The Copies To tab allows you to set up lists for people who have an interest in an item.  Copies To lists can include individuals or distribution lists.  If you include a distribution list on a Copies To list, you can click a hyperlink to see the members of the list.</p>
    <h2>Distribution Lists</h2>
    <p>Distribution lists are groups of recipients for emails and letters, which you can add to the Copies To tab for an item.  You can create global distribution lists for use by all projects (for example, a list of company directors), or distribution lists that are specific to a project.  Distribution lists can contain both personnel and contacts.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you include a distribution list on the Copies To tab of an item (other than a meeting), this creates a link to the distribution list; if the distribution list is later updated and the members of the list change, Copies To will use the updated list.</li>
      <li>If you use a distribution list on the Copies To tab or Attendees tab of a meeting, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> adds each member of the distribution list to the tab.  This means the Meeting Minutes print will always be the same, whether you print it immediately after the meeting or six months later.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you send an email about an item, the email screen includes <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> boxes for anyone on the Copies To list who has an email address, including each person currently on any distribution list used on the Copies To tab; the email will be copied to whoever you select.  </p>
