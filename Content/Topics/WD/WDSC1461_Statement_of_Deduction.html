    <h1 class="print">Statement of Deduction</h1>
    <p>Contractors must provide any subcontractor from whom tax has been deducted with documentary evidence of that deduction.  This can either be in the form of a monthly Statement of Payment and Deduction (sometimes called simply payment statement or deduction statement), or on a “per-payment” basis as part of the information supplied on the remittance advice or certificate.</p>
    <p>The documentary evidence must be issued no more than 14 days after the end of the tax month in which the payment is made.  There is no prescribed format for the statements, but they must include a set list of information.</p>
    <p>There is no obligation to issue a payment statement where the payment has been made gross (although the CIS 340 booklet says it is "good practice" to do so). Refer to sections 3.24 to 3.26 of the CIS 340 booklet.</p>
