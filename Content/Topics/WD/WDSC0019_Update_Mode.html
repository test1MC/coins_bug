        <p>Breakdown items can be deleted and added as required. This allows you to restructure the items as required, such as to match the items on a subcontractor claim. Before saving the certificate, a check is made that the total previous and cumulative values for the breakdown items match the previous and cumulative values for the certificate line.</p>
        <p>After any changes, the certified cumulative value for the breakdown items is totalled and the value is put into the cumulative column for the certificate line and subsequent lines are recalculated.</p>
        <p>Certificate lines which have a breakdown become read-only (non updateable). The values must be entered against the breakdown items. This is the case even for items such as discount and retention which would normally be calculated; instead you must manually enter the value.</p>
