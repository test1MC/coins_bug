        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Po Variations caps" /> allow you to document formally changes to your agreement with a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" />. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the order has not yet been committed, use Order Entry to amend the entire order. See <a href="WDPO0311_Entering_an_Order.html">Entering an Order</a>.</li>
            <li>If the order has been committed, you must enter a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.po variation" />: </li>
        </ul>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.po variations" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> appear as separate lines on <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquiries" />; whichever line you select, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> shows the current state of the order.&#160;</p>
        <p>During GRN entry and Invoice Matching, if there are amendment <MadCap:variable name="Variables.po variations" /> which change the price with effect from a given date, the date of the delivery determines which price <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> uses. </p>
        <p>There are two types of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.po variations" />: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="WDPO0335_Addendum_Amendment_Orders.html">Addendum/Amendment Orders</a> - for adding order lines or changing price and/or quantity. This normally prints as an order showing the originals of any amended lines, and the updated lines. You can also configure the order to print the reason and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr effective date" /> for each amendment. Alternatively, you can configure the purchase order form to print <MadCap:variable name="Variables.po variations" /> as the full amended order as it stands following the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.po variation" />.&#160; </li>
            <li><a href="WDPO0336_Cancellation_Orders.html">Cancellation Orders</a> - for cancelling an order. This prints as an order showing the original lines, but with the text <span class="field">NIL </span>instead of the quantity.
