    <h1 class="print">Temporary NI Numbers</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>As you may be aware the HMRC will no longer accept temporary NI numbers. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> still accepts them, but <em>will not</em> include the number on the employee's submission.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>There has been discussion of introducing HMRC Personal References (IRPRs) to employees in the absence of a NI number. IRPRs have 2 digits, 1 alphabetic, 5 digits, such as 12A34567 format. These numbers are not valid for submission, though some tax offices still insist on issuing them as if they are a valid NI number. We expect the use of IRPRs will be clarified in the next year or so.</p>
