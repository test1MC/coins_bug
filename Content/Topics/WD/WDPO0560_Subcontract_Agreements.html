        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> lets you keep track of the progress of subcontract agreements, and print reminder letters.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> keeps track of the progress of subcontract agreements through the various approval and signatory stages by using a list of "events". Events are “things that have happened to the agreement”. Each event also shows when it happened, and who did it.</p>
        <p>There are two types of event: automatic and manual.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automatic events are events that <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> generates as part of its processing. Procedures which deal with an agreement (for example, committing an order, accepting or rejecting an agreement, sending reminder letters) add automatic events to the list for that agreement.</li>
            <li>Manual events allow you to record stages in the progress of an agreement which are not related to automatic processing; for example, telephone conversations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recording an Agreement</h2>
        <p>When you enter an order, the <span class="field">Agreement Required</span><MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box allows you to specify that an agreement is required.&#160; If this is <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed, the Agreements tab is available, which allows you to record the details of the agreement. &#160;</p>

        <p><span class="function" title="Function:%WPO2100BPGT">SC Agreements Workbench</span> allows you to track and manage the progress of agreements. &#160;</p>

        <p>The dates for certain key events are shown on the screen, and choose actions allow you to record these key events for one or more selected agreements:</p>

        <p>If you reject an agreement, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> sets the <span class="field">Date Sent</span> and <span class="field">Date Received</span> fields to blank. If a rejected agreement is re-sent, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> sets the <span class="field">Date Rejected</span> field to blank.&#160;</p>
        <p>If an agreement has been sent but is not received back from the subcontractor within a specified number of days, the <span class="field">Date Received </span>column shows amber. &#160;If it is still not received after a further specified period, the column shows red.</p>
        <p>If an agreement has been received from the subcontractor but not agreed within a specified number of days, the <span class="field">Date Agreed</span> column shows amber.&#160; If it is still not agreed after a further specified period, the column shows red.</p>
        <p>You can filter on when reminder letters are due, and if an appropriate <a href="WDUG0018_Mail_Merge.html">Mail Merge</a> has been set up, you can send reminder letters to subcontractors and record the dates using an automatic action.</p>
        <p>All the events and their dates are shown on the Agreement Events screen (click the link on the Agreements browse to show the Agreement Events screen for an agreement).&#160; You can also use this to add events manually, to record other stages in the process.</p>
