        <h1 class="print">Overview of SRM</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <em><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Pl Supplier caps" /> Relationship Management</em> provides a structured view of the <strong><MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" /></strong> and <strong>subcontractors</strong> that make up your company's supply chain. Other principal participants in the procurement process, such as your projects and the trades and commodities that you deal with, are also given particular focus.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <em><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Pl Supplier caps" /> Relationship Management</em> sits "above" data already present in the Central Repository (which is a prerequisite for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <em><MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Relationship Management</em> ).</p>
        <p>Special emphasis is placed on the various <strong>approvals levels</strong> that you have allocated to your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" /> and subcontractors. So, for example, if you have categor<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed your <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" /> into "Supply Chain Partners", "Preferred <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" style="text-transform: capitalize;" />" and "Approved <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" style="text-transform: capitalize;" />" this can be specifically reflected in the SRM Workbench. The <strong>Search</strong> capability allows you to find <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" /> and subcontractors efficiently. The <strong>Group Spend</strong> features provides you with a tool to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.analyse" /> trading patterns with your supply chain.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Projects</strong> feature provides access to all aspects of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tenders" /> and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" /> in your system.&#160;The Performance section will be of special interest, for example, when evaluating how well your supply chain is performing on a particular <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />.</p>
        <p>The SRM Workbench also provides a "Category Management" view of your supply chain broken down by <strong>Trades</strong>, <strong>Materials</strong> and <strong><MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></strong>.&#160; This allows you to focus on particular parts of your business.&#160; So, for example, you can readily see how many preferred subcontractors are on file that carry out brickwork.&#160;This workbench also provides you with a <strong>Spend</strong> analysis broken down by trade, material and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" /> codes.</p>
        <p>The ability to maintain <strong>Trading Agreements</strong> means that you can directly influence how purchase orders are raised as well as monitor non-compliance.</p>
        <p><strong>Performance</strong> related data can be accessed in many ways depending upon your starting point.&#160;So, for example, you may choose to dwell on how well your subcontractors are performing in one particular trade.&#160; On another occasion, you might want to see how subcontractors on the whole are performing and then dig down to greater detail.</p>
