        <h2>Links</h2>
        <p>To provide a link to an HTML file or website (where <em>url</em> is the address of the file or website):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the help text for editing (see <MadCap:xref href="WDSY0033_Customising_Help_Text.html">Customing Help Text</MadCap:xref>).</li>
            <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/link1.gif" />.</li>
            <li>Enter the URL of the file or website, and the text to use as the link.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/SY/SY_003501.png" /></li>
            <li>If you want to display the file or website in a new window, select New Window in the Target drop-down.</li>
            <li>Click OK.</li>
            <li>Save the nugget.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Related fields</h2>
        <p>By default, if help text is specified for a field, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays the same text for "read only" and "report selection" versions of the field. These fields have names that begin with RO_ and RS_. So if a screen includes the field RO_avm_name, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will show the help text for avm_name, unless help for RO_avm_name also exists.</p>
        <h2>User access to fields</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> only displays help for fields that the user has access to, so if a field does not appear on the user's screen because they are not allowed access to that field, the help for that field will not appear either.</p>
        <h2>Showing names of help fields and functions</h2>
        <p>You can display the names of fields and functions on the help screen. Type &amp;helpMode=prompt at the end of the URL in the Address box and press Return. This re-loads the module, and the help frame shows the field and function names in brackets.</p>
        <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
        <div class="note">The field names are the names of the fields in the help - in some cases these are different to the actual fields on the screen (for example, the help may show the help for a related field).&#160; The "COINSInfo" screen shows the actual fields that are used - see <a href="WDSY0001_Technical_Help.html">Technical Help</a>.</div>
