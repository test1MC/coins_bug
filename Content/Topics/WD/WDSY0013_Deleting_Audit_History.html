        <p>Deleting audit history removes from disk any records of changes up to a calculated date. </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will not delete records that have not been processed and assigned an audit number. </p>
        <p>The last change made to a record is not deleted until the record itself has been deleted. This means that there will always be an audit record giving the last change made. </p>
