    <h1 class="print">Events</h1>
    <p>Within <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.customer care" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span>, you need to record key events that occur during the process. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For a call, these might include a site inspection or recording a response from the customer.</li>
      <li>For an issue, these might include changing the priority or status of an issue.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of the events are optional; others may be required in order to correctly manage the business process involved. There are some events you can only record if certain other events have already occurred (for example, you might want to make sure an out of warranty letter is only sent after the out of warranty event has been run), and normally these events will not be available until the prior event has been recorded. In addition, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> creates some events automatically, for example when you print a letter.</p>
    <p>Once events have been recorded, you can see them in the History tab on the summary page of the relevant record.</p>
    <div class="process">
      <h2 class="print">To record an event:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>From the Summary page for the record you want to add an event for, click the <b>Options</b> button.
<p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays a drop-down menu which includes the events that are available to you.</p><p><img src="../../Images/Customer Service Workbench/WDCC0164-Events-1.png" class="FullWidth" /></p></li>
        <li>Click the event you want to record.
<p>(Alternatively, click the History tab, use the Add Type drop-down to choose the event you want to add, and click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/add.svg" class="button" />.)</p><p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> displays an Add Event page. The fields available will depend on the specific event, but usually include at least a field for the date when the event occurred and a field for you to enter comments about the event.</p></li>
        <li>Enter the details of the event.</li>
        <li>If you want to create a follow-up action for yourself or another <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> user (for example, to remind a colleague to phone a purchaser, or to record an appointment you have arranged), <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the <span class="field">Follow Up?</span><MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box and fill in the details on the Follow Up Action tab. See <a href="WDHS0117_Setting_Reminders_Using_Actions.html">Actions</a>.</li>
        <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/save.svg" class="button" /> to save details of the event.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="print">Configuring events</h2>
      <p>Each type of record has a different set of events available, with a different maintenance function:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS2015BHEV">General Events</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS2016BHEV">Issue Events</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS2017BHEV">Call Events</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>See <a href="WDHS0153_Event_Configuration.html">Configuring <MadCap:variable name="Variables.customer care" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Events</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS2000BCOI">Standard Event Comments</span> allows you to set up standard text that users can include in the <span class="field">Comments </span>field when they record an event.</p>
      <p>You also need to set up event security to control who can run each event; see <a href="WDCC5001_Event_Security.html">Event Security</a>.</p>
