        <h1 class="print">Subcontractor RCT Details</h1>
        <p>Under the RCT scheme, you need to record additional details about subcontractors so that this information can be used for electronic contract notification and payment notification.</p>
        <div class="process">
            <h2 class="print">To enter subcontractors RCT details:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC2000BSBM">Subcontractor Maintenance</span>.</li>
                <li>Enter a new subcontractor record as normal or open an existing record.

                    <li><span class="field">Tax Scheme</span>:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For subcontractors outside the scope of RCT, enter <span class="userselect">X (Exempt)</span>.</li>
                        <li>If mandatory details for processing the subcontractor with RCT are not yet available, enter <span class="userselect">U (Unknown)</span>.</li>
                        <li>For all other subcontractors, enter <span class="userselect">V (Valid)</span>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><span class="field">Tax Reference Number </span>(also known as PPSN). If the subcontractor does not have an Irish tax reference, leave this blank and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the <span class="field">No Irish Tax Reference </span>box. You will then need to fill in&#160;the foreign tax reference details and various other fields depending on the business type of the subcontractor.&#160; These will be used in electronic contract notifications for this subcontractor.</li>
                    <li><span class="field">Fixed Place of Business</span>. This <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> box applies to all subcontractors and is used in electronic contract notifications for this subcontractor.</li>
                    <li><span class="field">Ongoing Contract?</span>: If the subcontractor has an ongoing contract which has already been notified to Revenue (see <a href="WDSC1499_Ongoing_Contracts.html">Ongoing Contracts</a>), <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> this box and fill in the following two fields:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="field">Contract Reference Number </span>- the contract ID as advised by Revenue.</li>
                        <li><span class="field">Contract End Date </span>- the end date of the contract.&#160; This and the Contract Reference Number will be the defaults on all new subcontracts for the subcontractor.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>If the ongoing contract is to be notified electronically using <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, then <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the <span class="field">Ongoing Contract </span>box but leave the <span class="field">Contract ID </span>blank.&#160; The start and end date fields can either be filled in here or on the Contract Notification Workbench later in the process.</p>
