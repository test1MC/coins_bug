    <h1 class="print">RTI Report</h1>
    <p>The RTI Report shows the data that will be submitted in a Full Payment Submission (FPS) or Earlier Year Update (EYU), allowing you to check it prior to submission.  The report is for an FPS if today's date is before the 20th April of the tax year following the year selected; otherwise it is for an EYU.</p>
    <p>The report output is in the form of a spreadsheet and an XML file which contain the data that will be submitted.  No PDF is produced, because there are too many columns to include on a printed report. </p>
    <p>Because the Full Payment Submission and Earlier Year Update relate to a pay frequency, there are separate versions of the RTI Report for each pay frequency.</p>

    <div class="note">The report gives the current position when you run it.  If the information in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> changes after you run the report, the data that is submitted will be different.</div>
