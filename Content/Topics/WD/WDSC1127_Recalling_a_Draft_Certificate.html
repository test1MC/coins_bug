    <h1 class="print">Recalling a Draft Certificate</h1>
    <p>Unless your security setting prevents you, you can "Recall" certificates once released for approval at the next level (to correct a mistake, or, if an approver approves the wrong payment cert by mistake). By default users will be able to recall any certificate.</p>
    <p>If there are any later draft certificates for the same order, these will be recalled also.  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> asks whether you wish to proceed if this is the case.</p>
    <div class="process">
