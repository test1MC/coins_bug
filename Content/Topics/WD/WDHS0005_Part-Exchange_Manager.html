The Part-exchange <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hr manager" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> is responsible for overseeing the life cycle of a part-exchange property. He/she manages the buy-in of the property such as arrangement of valuations, inspection of the property and preparing the offer value. In addition, the Part-exchange <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hr manager" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> will also handle the sale on of a property. This includes the appointing of an estate agent, instructions made to solicitors and monitoring of the sales process. 
</p>
    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> House Sales will enable the Part-exchange <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hr manager" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> to carry out administrative tasks such as organ<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation of correspondence to buyers, vendors and utilities companies. House Sales can record valuations that have been carried out, and then calculate an offer value for the property; this will help the Part-exchange <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hr manager" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> to prepare an offer value. Another key feature of House Sales is the Workflow; by using this functionality the Part-exchange <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hr manager" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> will fulfil his/her daily tasks efficiently and professionally. It will also encourage him/her to be proactive in the management of part-exchange properties (for example notification of a new reservation with part-exchange, cancellations and missed deadlines).
