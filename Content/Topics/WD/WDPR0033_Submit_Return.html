    <p>Once any validation errors have been resolved, the status of the return will be ?Complete?.  </p>
    <p>To submit the return, simply select the Submit option. This will submit the return using a background process. The status will change from ?Complete? to ?Submitting?.  </p>
    <p>Once the return has been successfully submitted, the status will change to ?Submitted?; this may take a while. You can come back to the In Year Movements workbench later to check that the submission has been successful.</p>
    <p>The Submission process is the same as per the End-of-Year return: see <a href="WDPR0035_Overview.html">UK Online End of Year Submissions</a> for full details.<br /></p>
