        <p>One of the important benefits of using Project Management is being able to find related information quickly.&#160; Every item has a Linked tab, which lists any other items that have been linked to it.&#160; Hyperlinks allow you to go quickly to any linked item.&#160; </p>

        </p>
        <p>Linking is reciprocal, so if <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pt transmittal" /> Y is linked to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pt issue" /> X, that means <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pt issue" /> X is linked to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pt transmittal" /> Y.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> establishes some links automatically; for example, when you generate a letter for an item, that letter is automatically linked to the item.&#160; You can also create links between items manually.&#160;</p>
