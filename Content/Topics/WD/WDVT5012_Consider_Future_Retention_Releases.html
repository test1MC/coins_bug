            <h1 class="print">Consider Handling of Future Retention Releases</h1>
            <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> regulations provide for two different situations with regard to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> on retention releases:</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>"Where an invoice is raised for the full consideration, including retention, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> liability arises on the full consideration when that invoice is raised."</strong>
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">In this case, you should already be using a subcontract certificate definition within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> which calculates <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> before retention. Any retention release is then effectively outside the scope of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> since the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> has already been accounted for.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">Likewise, if this applies to your sales, you should already be using a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales" />certificate definition within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> which calculates <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> before retention. Any retention release is then effectively outside the scope of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> since the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> has already been accounted for.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>"Where retention is not invoiced until the retention is paid liability on the retention arises on payment."</strong>
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 60px;">In this case, you should already be using a subcontract certificate definition within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> which calculates <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> after retention. Any retention release is then liable to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> at the date of that release. Provided that the default <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> code on the Subcontract has been updated to the new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> rate as appropriate, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> should then automatically apply the correct rate to future transactions (except where there is a split <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> analysis on the subcontract where manual intervention will be required by users).</p>
