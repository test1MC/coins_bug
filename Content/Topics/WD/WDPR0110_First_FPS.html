    <h1 class="print">First FPS</h1>
    <p>Where HMRC does not require an EAS and the PAYE scheme is used on just one pay frequency in one <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> it will be possible to simply do a first FPS without needing to do an EAS, though an EAS will always be allowed if the employer wants to submit this anyway. Whether or not an EAS has been sent, the first FPS for each <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> payroll will include all employees who have been previously paid in the tax year regardless of whether they have left or not been paid in the current period. If no EAS has been sent the first FPS will include everyone employed in the current tax year including leavers and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr starter" />s who have not yet been paid, but have had an In Year Movements <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pr starter" /> form sent already.</p>
    <p>As with the EAS this first FPS is for the transition period and will only be required to include leavers and employees not being paid in the period until the end of November 2013. </p>
