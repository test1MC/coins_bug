    <h1 class="print">Batch Control Totals</h1>
    <p>Batch control totals act as a check that the transactions have been entered correctly. </p>
    <p>For each batch, you can type batch control totals before entering the batch. When you have finished entering the batch, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will check the batch control totals against the actual totals for those fields. If they are not the same, someone needs to take action: for example, to enter more transactions, correct transaction details, or change the batch totals. </p>
    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will only display a control total if the batch type has been configured to show the total. If a total field is not shown, then it is excluded when checking to see if a batch is balanced. </p>
    <p>If the total is shown, then it is disabled for input unless any of the following are true: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are adding a new batch. </li>
      <li>You are a member of the ROOT user group or you are logged in as sysadmin. </li>
      <li>It is not your batch, and you have permission to post the batch. </li>
      <li>
        <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is configured to allow users to change their own batch totals <br /></li>
    </ul>
