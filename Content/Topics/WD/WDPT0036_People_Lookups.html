        <h1 class="print">People Lookups</h1>
        <p>Throughout the <span class="function" title="Function:%WPT1000SPIJ">Communication Management</span> workbench you need to record who items are received from, who they are sent to, or who is responsible. People involved with a project include subcontractors, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" /> and client staff (all of whom are external contacts) as well as your own employees (personnel).&#160; </p>

        </p>
        <p>To make it easier to look up and enter contacts and personnel, you can use any of the tabs that may appear when you do a people lookup:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Project Team ? This tab lets you set up a project team that combines selected personnel and contacts into a single list. In fields that require you to enter a person, you can use the lookup to select people from the project team.</li>
            <li>Personnel ? This tab allows you to select personnel (which are set up in <span class="function" title="Function:%WMK1500HPOR">Personnel</span>).</li>
            <li>Contacts ? This tab allows you to select contacts (which are set up in the <span class="function" title="Function:%WCI1010BPCN">Contacts Workbench</span>).</li>
            <li>Distribution Lists ? This tab lets you select distribution lists. See <a href="WDPT0049_Copies_To_Tab.html">Copies To Tab</a>.</li>
            <li>New Contact ? This tab lets you add a new contact to send copies to; you can use this tab to:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Select an existing contact. To speed up entry, instead of using the lookup you can type the first few letters of the person's <MadCap:variable name="Variables.last name" /> and press <span class="key">Tab</span> or <span class="key">Return</span>; <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> searches the project team, then the personnel list, then the contacts list, and fills in the first name it finds that matches what you enter. </li>
                <li>Create a new contact.<br /></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
