    <h2>See Also links</h2>
    <p>As well as <a href="WDDM0006_Standard_Links_Images_and_Text.html">entering links to other topics</a> in the body of the text, you can add "see also" lists of topics after each section.  Enter a comma-separated list of the topic function codes in the <span class="field">See Also </span>field on the Links tab.</p>
    <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
    <Div class="note">It might be a good idea to write topics to use the See Also lists instead of links in the text, wherever possible.  If a user's function access permissions don't give them access to a topic, links to that topic in the text are disabled; See Also links to that topic are hidden.</Div>
    <h2>Parameters</h2>
    <p>If there are parameters that are relevant to the topic, you can display the parameter help text in the configuration section of the topic. Enter a comma-separated list of the parameter codes in the <span class="field">Parameters </span>field on the Links tab of the Configuration section; for example <span class="userinput">PL/STOPBLNK,PL/STOPDUP</span>.</p>
    <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
    <div class="note">The <span class="field">Parameters </span>field does not become available on a new Configuration section until after you save it. Save the section first, then edit it to add the parameters.</div>
    <h2>Pasting from Word</h2>
    <p>While it is possible to copy and paste text from Word directly into the HTML editor, we <strong>strongly recommend</strong> you do not do this, because Word creates very bloated HTML with lots of additional tags. To copy and paste text from an existing document, we therefore suggest using one of the following methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Paste the text first into a text editor (such as Notepad), copy and paste from there, and use the HTML editor to apply any formatting.</li>
      <li>Use PureText, which is a tool that can be downloaded to your computer. PureText allows you to copy text from a web page or a document and then paste it as simple text into another application (such as HTML editor) without getting all the formatting from the original source. Once you have downloaded PureText.exe, you will see a 'PT' tray icon appear near the clock on your task bar. Simply select and copy the text, click on the 'PT' icon, and paste the text into the HTML editor, where you can then apply any formatting. For more information and to download this tool, go to <a href="http://www.stevemiller.net/puretext/">http://www.stevemiller.net/puretext/</a>.</li>
    </ul>
