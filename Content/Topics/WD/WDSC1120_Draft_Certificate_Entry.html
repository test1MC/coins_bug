    <h1 class="print">Draft Certificate Entry</h1>
    <p>Draft Certificate Entry allows you to enter and amend draft subcontractor payment certificates and to release them for author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation.</p>
    <p>The entry of certificates is controlled by up to four workbenches: <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/DCWBN.flsnp" />. They are configured to control which subcontracts are eligible for selection depending on their billing method. In this way it is anticipated that a tighter control can be applied to the correct <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> documentation being available for inspection when needed. However these controls can only ever be as good as individual processes allow.</p>
    <p>The workbenches display both newly-entered and rejected certificates.  Certificates on these workbenches have status <strong>0</strong> (attention required) or <strong>1</strong> (released/awaiting level 2 author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation). Which certificates are displayed in each workbench depends on the filter options (specifically <span class="field"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /></span>, <span class="field">Subcontractor</span>, <span class="field">Billing Type</span> and <span class="field">Released</span>).</p>
    <p>The following rules apply to draft certificates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Users can only add for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" /> for which their level 1 security is set.</li>
      <li>You cannot add new draft certificates for orders which have any unposted 'actual' (as opposed to draft) certificates assigned.</li>
      <li>The next transaction number for the order is assigned and can't be changed.</li>
      <li>The valuation date defaults from the certificate date if it is blank.</li>
      <li>The certificate number field is <MadCap:variable name="Variables.grey" />ed out and is blank.</li>
    </ul>
