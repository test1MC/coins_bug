    <h1 class="print">Ongoing Contracts</h1>
    <p>Some subcontractors are treated for RCT purposes as operating under a single ongoing contract even though they work across a number of different sites.  For these subcontractors, you only need to register one contract with Revenue even though, on <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, there may be a number of separate subcontracts and/or orders. (This is the case if the terms and conditions for each subcontract or order are the same, and the subcontractor is not re-tendering for the work.  </p>
    <p>In v10.22 and v10.23 of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, for subcontractors with ongoing contracts you would enter the default contract registration details against the subcontractor record.  These were then copied to each new subcontract, order and invoice, and there were actions to copy the details from the subcontractor to existing subcontracts.  If such a subcontractor had to have a separate subcontract registered with Revenue, you could override the default contract registration details on any subcontract, order or invoice. </p>
    <p>This caused difficulties, however, if the details of the ongoing contract changed, so from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> v10.25 onwards, the details of ongoing contracts are only held on the subcontractor record; subcontract records simply have a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box to indicate whether the subcontract belongs to the ongoing contract.</p>
    <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
    <div class="note">As part of the upgrade process to v10.25, for any subcontractor with an ongoing contract, all subcontracts with the same Contract ID as the ongoing Contract ID have the new ongoing <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed and the Contract ID removed.  These will then make them consistent with any new subcontracts entered after the upgrade on subcontractors with an ongoing contract.
