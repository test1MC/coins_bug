    <h1 class="print">Lieu Days</h1>
    <p>Days in lieu awarded to employees for working unpaid outside their normal working hours can be recorded in HR and taken into account when dealing with available <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holidays" />. This information is visible in both the HR and Employee Self Service modules.</p>
    <p>There is a 'Lieu Days' tab in <span class="function" title="Function:%WHRBPOR">Personnel Workbench</span> where any lieu days awarded can be recorded, including the date awarded and an optional <MadCap:variable name="Variables.expiry" /> date by which the lieu days must be taken. The number of days must be a whole number of half days. To allow for days in lieu which are accrued gradually you are allowed to set the days initially as zero and use the <span class="field">Notes </span>field to record the number of hours in lieu accrued until there is enough to properly fill in a lieu days value.</p>
    <p>The lieu days will be used in precedence to the rest of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday" /> allowance for an employee for any <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holidays" /> between the date awarded and the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.expiry" /> date inclusive. Once the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.expiry" /> date has passed, any lieu days not used will be shown as expired and no longer add into the total available <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holidays" /> for the year. This does not prevent you from retrospectively adding a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday" /> between the awarded and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.expiry" /> date which will then still use such expired days. Allocation of lieu days is automatic with no need to specify that a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday" /> is using lieu days when it is entered.</p>
    <p>The 'Other' tab in <span class="function" title="Function:%WHRBPOR">Personnel Workbench</span> shows a summary of the lieu days for the current <MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday" /> year.</p>
    <p>Employee Self Service shows both a summary of lieu days, and a tab showing all lieu days records.</p>
    <p>The <span class="function" title="Function:%WHR7000RPOR"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Year End</span> process and the <span class="function" title="Function:%WHR3230RPOR"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.holiday" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Report</span> reports show columns for lieu days.</p>
