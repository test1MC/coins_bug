        <p>The main content of a GL report will be <span class="module">General Ledger</span> account lines.</p>
        <p>Account lines display information from the <span class="module">General Ledger</span> account record. For example you may want the balance of the account, the description of the account or the account number. These would all require an Account Line to be selected.</p>
        <p>You select which accounts to include in the report by entering an account row, and filling in a <span class="Field">From</span> and <span class="Field">To</span> range, or a can-do list in the <span class="Field">Matches</span> field.&#160; You can select accounts by whole account, sector, expense code, analysis set etc. You can also use <a href="WDGL0013_Report_Tokens.html">Report Tokens</a>&#160;to allow the user to specify which accounts to include when they run the report.</p>
        <p>If an account line is shown in detail, a line will appear in the report for every individual account that is included in the selection. If the line is shown in Summary (detail flag un-<MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed), only one line will be displayed showing the balance of the entire account range selected. Therefore, it is possible for the report definition to just contain one Account line (selecting all accounts) and if <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed as Detailed, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will display a row in the report for every account.</p>

I.e. you may be writing a report in company No. 001, but wish to report on companies 001, 002 and 003. Specify the company group to select from here. Note that it may therefore be desirable to create a company group for each individual COINS company (in the System module of COINS) as well as a group of ‘all companies’. That way, you could specify a report that produced either report rows or columns of each COINS company, plus a consolidated view.</p>
