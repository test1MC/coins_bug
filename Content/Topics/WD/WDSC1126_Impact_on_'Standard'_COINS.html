    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> uses a dummy SC certificate batch number 999998 to hold draft certificates. This batch is marked as cancelled. </p>
    <p>Standard certificates can be entered for an order, but only if there are no draft certificates currently associated with the same order. Certificates entered this way are regarded as "adjustments" if the draft certification processing is running (so it should be done sparingly). </p>
    <p>Certificates batched from draft certificates are given an auto-generated certificate number (as an integer) as they are processed which should be contiguous (that is, there should be no gaps in the certificate number sequence). This certificate number should not be amended. Adjustment certificates entered through the standard <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> certificate input screen can have their certificate numbers updated. Adjustment certificates must have at least one letter entered to distinguish them from draft certificates. <br /></p>
