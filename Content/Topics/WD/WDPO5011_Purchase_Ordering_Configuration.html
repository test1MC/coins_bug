    <h1 class="print">Purchase Ordering Configuration</h1>
    <p>Purchase Ordering in its fullest form consists of order entry (materials, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" /> and subcontract), GRN (delivery note) processing and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" /> allocation, tracking subcontract agreements, and matching of invoices to GRNs.</p>
    <p>For smaller sites and short projects, the overheads in terms of time, cost and organ<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation may not justify the processing of GRNs or detailed <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" /> sheet allocations. If this is the case, set the <span class="field">Accrual method </span>field on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> record (in the <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Status Ledger</span>) to <strong>O</strong>. GRNs will then not be required and accruals will be based on the due dates of orders.</p>
    <p>There are two ways to use Purchase Ordering:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Linked directly to the ledgers (<span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.purchase ledger" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span>and <span class="module">Subcontractors Ledger</span>).</li>
      <li>Linked to the ledgers through the Company Information Workbench (this is the recommended approach to get full benefit from the Purchase Ordering functionality).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To use the Company Information Workbench, set the parameter <span class="parameter">USECIS </span>in each of the ledgers to <strong>Y.</strong> Use the function parameters for individual procedures to determine whether the procedure links to the Company Information Workbench or the ledgers.</p>
