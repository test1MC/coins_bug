    <p>The IRS may inform an employer it must withhold a certain amount from an employee's wages that is necessary to repay Federal taxes owed to the government by the employee. If such a "levy" is necessary, the IRS will inform the employer using Form 668-W, Notice of Levy on Wages, Salary, and Other Income (see 3929). The employer must then determine what portion of the employee's wages is subject to the levy.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>For employees receiving a single computer <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> in one pay period:</strong> After timesheets are entered and calculations have been run, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will compute and automatically reduce Net Pay to the Per Period Income Exempt from IRS Levy and accumulate the difference in the Pay Calculation holding the Levy Deduction.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>For employees receiving multiple computer <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" /> in one pay period:</strong> After timesheets are entered and calculations are run, and all necessary deductions have been taken from the employee's pay, any <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> after the first will have all wages garnished down to a Net Pay of zero.</p>
      <p>The calculation will automatically end when the Total Maximum Limit is met or the calculation becomes dormant.</p>
