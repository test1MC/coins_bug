        <h1 class="print">Manual Contract Notification</h1>
        <p>If you are using <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> v10.22 or v10.23, you will need to notify Relevant Contracts using ROS, and record in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> the fact that the contract has been notified.&#160; You may also choose to do this for some or all Relevant Contracts even if you are using a later version of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <div class="process">
            <h2 class="print">To update notification details for a subcontract manually:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Notify the contract on ROS.</li>
                <li>Open the subcontract record in <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC2010BSBS">Subcontract Maintenance</span>.</li>
                <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
                <div class="note">You can use <span class="function" title="Function:%WSC1370BSBS">Subcontract RCT Details Review/Update</span> if you find it more convenient.</div>
                <li>If this subcontract is part of an ongoing contract for the subcontractor then just <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the <span class="field">Ongoing Contract </span><MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box as this subcontract does not then need to be notified separately.&#160; Otherwise fill in the following fields:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="field">Contract ID</span>: This is the unique identifier for the Relevant Contract as allocated by Revenue at Contract Notification.&#160; This needs to be included in the Payment Notification for every payment under that contract.&#160;&#160; </li>
                    <li>End Date of Work (<span class="field">End Date </span>field): This is mandatory for subcontracts which are Relevant Contracts as Payment Notifications will not be accepted by Revenue more than six months after the end date.&#160; 
<p>(Where a subcontract takes longer than initially envisaged, the end date can be changed using the Amend Contract Registration process on ROS, and then the amended date should be recorded in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.) <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will issue a warning message when transactions are processed after the end date.</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images_S-U/SC/SC_150001.png" class="FullWidth" /></p></li>
