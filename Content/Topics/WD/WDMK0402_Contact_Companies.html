    <h1 class="print">Contact Companies</h1>
    <p>You can maintain details of the company a contact works at, and of other companies they have worked at. However, a contact does not necessarily have to belong to a company.</p>
    <p>The contact detail shows the contact's current company, and a tab on the contact record shows all companies the contact is associated with.  If you enter a new company record on the Companies tab, and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the <span class="field">Current </span><MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box, that becomes the contact's current company.</p>
    <p>If the contact's phone or fax numbers are blank, when you enter a company <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> fills in the phone numbers from the company.</p>
