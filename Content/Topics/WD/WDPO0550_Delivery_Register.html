            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Delivery Register</h1>
        <p>The Delivery Register allows you to record detailed information about deliveries of concrete and reinforcing steel (for example, the site location of the delivery, extra information related to the type of delivery, quality test requirements and the results of those tests). You enter the information as part of the GRN entry, and can update it and report on it later. You can record different types of detail for different commodities.</p>

            <p>Currently the Delivery Register can only be used for concrete and reinforcing steel, but could be extended for other commodities. Contact <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> for details.</p>
