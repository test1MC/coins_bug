    <h1 class="print">Transport Scheduler</h1>
    <p>The Transport Scheduler gives a time-line view of the one depot's transport requests on a route; out and back between two locations).   There is a row per transport with two additional rows for unassigned tasks and tasks assigned to external resource at the top.  </p>
    <p> You can drag and drop requests to change the assigned transport. When doing so any change in timing is ignored so you don't have to be careful to keep the time the same. If you drag and drop a request that is more than the receiving asset can handle, only what the asset can carry will be moved and the remainder will be left where it was.</p>
    <p>When not assigned to an asset requests are shown separately.  For planned cargo types an asset journey will be shown with a header event for the journey, and then events for each item in the load.  This allows you to drag items out of the load, or drag the header to reassign the whole load.  For unit cargo types, only a header is shown.  </p>
    <p>Double-click on an event to open a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.dialogue" /> box with expanded details.  For transport requests this allows you to change the zone band and class of charge.  </p>
