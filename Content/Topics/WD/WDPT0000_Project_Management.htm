        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Project Management provides the tools that construction project managers need to control project-related communications and proactively manage change orders.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Control and Administer Contracts</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Project Management Module gathers the tools needed for project management and administration into a unified project level menu.</p>
        <p>The Project Management Module enables project managers (PMs) to quickly enter, transmit, and manage Requests for Information (RFIs), meetings minutes, daily reports, and other project communications.</p>
        <p>External files, including spreadsheets and scanned documents, can be associated with any project.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Manage Project Documents</h2>
        <p>Project managers can produce, distribute, search for and retrieve project communications of all kinds without leaving <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Project Management:</p>
        <p>• Email.</p>
        <p>• Meeting minutes.</p>
        <p>• RFIs.</p>
        <p>• Drawings and drawing sets.</p>
        <p>• Issues that need to be tracked.</p>
        <p>• Daily reports.</p>
        <p>The Communication Workbench helps PMs find documents quickly and makes it easier to focus on open tasks, with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.colour" /> coding for overdue items. Its timeline view gives the PM quick access to communication or task information at a given point in time. Different types of documents often relate to the same project issue, so the Linked tab brings them together - making it easier to manage and research requests for information, replies, design changes, and other project issues.</p>
