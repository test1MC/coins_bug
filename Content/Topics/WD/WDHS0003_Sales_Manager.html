    <p>The Sales <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hr manager" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> is primarily responsible for running a team of Site Sales Administrators, ensuring that target sales revenues are being achieved. In addition, he/she will make sure that a high standard of customer satisfaction is maintained at all times. Creating intelligent, understandable reports for the board is also one of the Sales <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hr manager" style="text-transform: capitalize;" />'s key tasks, such as the Weekly Sales Activity and Forecast versus Actual Performance reports.</p>
    <p>Within the House Sales module, the flexible reporting tool will enable the Sales <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hr manager" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> to assess his/her team's performance by creating accurate reports with real-time information. The in-built author<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation process will give him/her the ability to review and approve plot reservations. This can be done for all reservations or exclusively to a reservation that is outside of the Site Sales Administrator's limits. Furthermore, the Workflow functionality will help the Sales <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hr manager" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> to fulfil his/her daily tasks efficiently and allow him/her to be proactive in the management of his/her department (for example, notification of reservations, cancellations and missed deadlines).
