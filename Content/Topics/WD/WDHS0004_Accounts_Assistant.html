    <h1 class="print">Accounts Assistant</h1>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The Accounts Assistant is responsible for the processing of cash and financial transactions relating to a sale. This includes recording of monies received, refunds (as a result of a cancellation) and input of final account journals. 
</p>
    <p>Because the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> House Sales module is fully integrated with the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Financials modules, the Accounts Assistant is able to record information accurately, which will avoid cash from being allocated to the wrong sale. The production of the final account can be automated with House Sales which will assist in the identification of discrepancies with the appropriate legal team.
