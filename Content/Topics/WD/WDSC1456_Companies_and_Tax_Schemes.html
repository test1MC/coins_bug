      <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Kco Companies caps" /> and Tax Schemes</h1>
    <p>A scheme in CIS terms is a reporting entity as registered with HMRC.  If <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" />, divisions or branches share the same UTR, tax office reference and Accounts Office Reference, they belong to the same scheme.  Separate schemes frequently share the same UTR but have different Tax Office References and Accounts Office References.</p>
    <p>The most common configuration is to have each <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> as a separate tax scheme.  <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can handle more than one scheme in a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />, or a scheme that uses a number of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" />, or you can mix the two approaches, as it is how the payments resolve into schemes that matters.  </p>
    <p>You will only be able to make one submission per scheme in any one period.   This means that you must not have the same scheme in more than one <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> unless the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" /> have been linked for CIS tax purposes (see <a href="WDSC1459_More_Than_One_Scheme_in_a_Company.html">More Than One Scheme in a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></a>).<br /></p>
