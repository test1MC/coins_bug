            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Interrelated Data</h1>
        <p>One of the strengths of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.marketing" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> </span>is that information is interrelated, so that for example you can look at a client record and find out what <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk projects" /> you have already worked on for that client. You can then link to one of those <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk projects" /> to find out which <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk project" /> staff were involved. By looking at an individual's record you can see what skills and experience they have, or what useful contacts they have.</p>
        <p>This also means that as you gain more information about clients,&#160;<MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk projects" /> and contacts, you can build on the data already stored in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.&#160; That new information will then be available in other ways and to other users.</p>
