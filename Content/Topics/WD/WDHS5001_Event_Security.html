    <h1 class="print">Event Security</h1>
    <p>Many of the workbenches have events associated with them. Events allow you to record things that happen relating to the workbench, such as receiving a telephone call, selling a plot or completing a part-exchange. You can set permissions that control which users can run which events. For example, you might only want to allow certain users to cancel a sale.</p>
