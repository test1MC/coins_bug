        <h1 class="print">Options and Actions</h1>
        <p>For each type of item (such as <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pt rfis" />, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pt issues" />, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pt submittals" />), there are a number of things you can do (such as send an email or print a document).&#160; These vary for each type of item.&#160; They are available as a list of Actions on the relevant browse screen (where you can select one or more items you want to run the action for).&#160; The same list is also available as an Options menu when you are looking at the detail of an individual item; this means you do not have to go back to the browse screen to run the action.</p>
        <h2>Sending Emails</h2>
        <p>Each type of item has a standard email template, which is used as the default text when you send an email.&#160; The email template can contain tokens for database fields, such as the name or code of the item, which <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> then fills in with the relevant data. You can edit the email text before you send it.&#160; </p>

        </p>
        <p>If there are any names on the Copies To list for the item, these are available as <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> boxes on the email; you can choose who to send to as well as enter other email addresses manually.</p>
        <p>If there are any documents associated with the item, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> boxes allow you to choose which documents to attach to the email.</p>
        <p>You can also send emails containing documents that relate to the project as a whole, using the Options menu from the main <span class="function" title="Function:%WPT1000SPIJ">Communication Management</span> screen.</p>
        <h2>Letters</h2>
        <p>Some types of items allow you to generate letters.&#160; These are based on standard templates and are opened as RTF documents in Word.&#160; The letter templates can contain tokens for database fields, such as the addressee's name and address; <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> then replaces these tokens with the relevant data when the letter is created (like a mail merge letter).</p>
        <p>Letters you generate are available on the <a href="WDPT0051_Linked_Tab.html">"Linked" tab</a> of the item, and also on the "Communications &gt; Letters" tab.</p>
        <p>Letters can have a reference code which <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> generates automatically based on the format you specify.<br /></p>
