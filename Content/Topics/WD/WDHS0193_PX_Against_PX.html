    <h1 class="print">Part Exchange Against Part Exchange</h1>
    <p>If you have a buyer for a part-exchange property who wants you to take their current property in part-exchange, you can record a PX against the PX.  This is very similar to recording a PX against a plot.</p>
    <div class="process">
      <h2 class="print">Recording a PX against a PX</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <span class="function" title="Function:%WHS1020SHPX">Part Exchange Workbench</span>.</li>
        <li>Open the record for the part-exchange property you are selling.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>More </strong>tab.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>PX Against PX</strong> tab.</li>
        <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/add.svg" class="button" />.</li>
        <li>Fill in the details of the property that the buyer wants you to take in part exchange.  Refer to the side frame help.</li>
        <li>Click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/save.svg" class="button" />.
<p>When you save the part-exchange, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> generates a reference number.</p></li>
      </ol>
