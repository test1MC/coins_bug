    <h1 class="print">Multi-Currency Purchase Ordering</h1>
    <h2>Orders</h2>
    <p>When you raise an order, the currency on the office determines the currency of the order.</p>
    <p>The Totals frame (click the <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/total.svg" class="button" />) displays the totals in the document currency, and also in the base currency.</p>
    <p>Note that the base currency totals are calculated on the exchange rate that applies when the order is committed.</p>
    <p>The Gains and Losses sheet (if used) must be completed in the base currency.</p>
    <h2>GRNs</h2>
    <p>When entering a GRN, if you add unordered goods to the GRN, the price must be in the foreign currency.</p>
    <h2>Invoice matching</h2>
    <p>The invoice matching screen shows the amount to be matched in the document currency.<br /></p>
