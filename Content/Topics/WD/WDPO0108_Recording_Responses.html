    <p>If you have used <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to send the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquiry" /> as a spreadsheet, and have received completed spreadsheets back from the companies you sent them to, you can load the responses back into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, and compare the quotations.</p>
    <p>If you have used another method to send out the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquiry" />, or if you have not received a spreadsheet back from a company, you can record whether you have received a response, whether they have given a Quote or Declined, and (if they have declined to quote) the reason why they declined.</p>
