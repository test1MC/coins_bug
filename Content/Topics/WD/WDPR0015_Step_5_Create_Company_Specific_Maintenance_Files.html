    <p>Before using the <span class="module">Payroll</span> module, there are a number of steps that should be performed initially to set it up in effective working order. Step 5 is outlined below.</p>
    <p>After you have performed these initial steps, you are ready to process Payroll (see <a href="WDPR0004_Processing_Payroll.html">Processing Payroll</a>).</p>
    <div class="process">
      <h2 class="print">To create other <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> specific maintenance files:</h2>
      <p>In <span class="function" title="Function:%WPR231BPAG">Allocation Groups</span>, add allocation groups, which are groups of calculations that will run if specfic criteria are met during timecard entry. These calculations create additional burdens to Payroll transactions. Allocation groups are associated with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" /> and employees. When all criteria are met, the calculations associated with the group will run against a timecard.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In <span class="function" title="Function:%WPR233BCGR">Caption Groups</span>, add caption groups. These groups are used to construct a collection of user defined fields that can be accessed by <span class="function" title="Function:%WP69200BEMP">Employee Maintenance</span>.</li>
        <li>In <span class="function" title="Function:%WPR233BCAP">Caption Maintenance</span>, add captions. This function is used to define user defined fields associated with caption groups and used in <span class="function" title="Function:%WP69200BEMP">Employee Maintenance</span>. Fields can be logical, decimal, integer, character, or date. The fields may be designed to contain default values and can be set to require updating.</li>
        <li>In <span class="function" title="Function:%WPR234BLOC">Locations</span>, create a list of valid locations for the Payroll <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />. Locations can be used for security and are included in a base set of selectors for functions associated with Payroll.</li>
        <li>In <span class="function" title="Function:%WPR215BQRD">Departments</span>, create a list of valid departments for the Payroll <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />. Departments can be used for security and are included in a base set of selectors for functions associated with Payroll.</li>
        <li>In <span class="function" title="Function:%WPR9BCOA">Analysis Sets</span>, add analysis sets. Analysis sets are used as a tool to create configurable groupings. The title of each Analysis field is defined in <span class="function" title="Function:%WPR211SQRP"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Configuration</span>, and allowable entries into individual analysis sets (look up values) are defined here. If necessary, you can use a field within an analysis set to create complex Payroll security.</li>
