    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can submit month-end returns (COINSplus and OA) and subcontractor verification batches (OA only) electronically to HMRC using the Government Gateway.</p>
    <p>Submission is a two-sided conversation rather than simply sending the data.  When the data is submitted there are a number of possible responses, and each response requires further action.  The rules of this <MadCap:variable name="Variables.dialogue" /> are known as the “Protocol”, and the stage you have reached is known as the “State”.</p>
    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> makes submissions using a background process. The reason for using a background process is technical; the PROGRESS session that creates the XML file has to be run with a UTF-8 code page so that the gateway will be able to read it. </p>
