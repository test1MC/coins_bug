        <h1 class="print">Overview</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Cash Flow and Profit Forecasting is an Open Architecture (OA) module of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> software used by house builders and developers to automate the production of long-range profit forecasts and budgets.</p>
        <p>Forecasting is a single solution for collating data from multiple appraisals, multiple <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco companies" /> and both proposed and existing <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vp sites" />. It is highly configurable, giving the user control over which information they want to see. Multiple views can be defined and configured at various levels of detail.</p>
        <h2>Flow of Data</h2>
        <p>Forecasting can be used to present information from various <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> financial ledgers, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.La Land Management caps" /> and House Sales. The flow of data through to the module can be summar<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed in the following diagram:</p>

            <br />
            <br />The links between <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> modules (shown in blue) are determined by configuration choices made in both <MadCap:variable name="Variables.La Land Management caps" /> and Forecasting. Data flow is controlled in Forecasting through a regeneration process which prevents data from being updated except at the request of the user.</p>Optionally, Forecasting can also be integrated with data from ASTA via <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> House Sales.
