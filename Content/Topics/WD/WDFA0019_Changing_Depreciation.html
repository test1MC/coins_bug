    <h1 class="print">Changing Depreciation</h1>
    <p>When using cumulative depreciation there are 3 ways to change the course of depreciation for an asset:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="function" title="Function:%WFA1181BFAR">Enter Adjustments</span>
        <br />An adjustment is the way to make corrections to the primary or secondary depreciation, allowing you to change start date, method, initial and minimum values.</li>
      <li>Revaluation<br />Revaluation is for the rare occasion you decide an asset is incorrectly valued and you want to back out all historical depreciation and begin again from the current period.  For example if you had an old vehicle you realised is a collectors item rather than junk.  Revaluations only affect the primary depreciation. The value of the revaluation can be captured in revaluation accounts - see <a href="WDFA0015_Revaluation.html">FA Posting Example - Revaluation</a></li>
      <li>Change Asset Economic Life<br />This is only available for assets depreciated on a straight line basis.  It is a process whereby you decide that a group of assets has been depreciated incorrectly.  For example you have been depreciating over 3 years, but find you are getting an average life of 5 years.  The key difference to entering an adjustment is that you want to kink the straight line, so changing from 3 to 5 years, an asset initially worth <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />3600, now with WDV of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />100 after 35 periods, would depreciate <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />4 per period for the remaining 25 periods of its life.</li><![CDATA[ ]]></ul><![CDATA[ ]]><![CDATA[ ]]></body>
