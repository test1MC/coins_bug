        <h1 class="print">What If Scenarios</h1>
        <p>What If scenarios are an optional list of potential happenings that can have an impact upon the data in a forecast. The types of scenario that can be applied are fixed, but for each it is possible to specify the timing and rate of the impact they model. Each can be applied to be forecast more than once.</p>

        <p>Against each What If there is a flag, <span class="field">Include in Calculation</span>, that determines whether or not that particular scenario will be applied to the forecast when the values are recalculated to take into account What Ifs. This can also be set for more than one scenario at once using an action (at the bottom of the screen).</p>
        <p>The rates for changes to inflation and interest are set using the What If Rates screen once that particular What If scenario has been selected for inclusion in the forecast. For each item requiring a rate there is an option against the scenario that determines whether or not the rate is annual<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed.</p>
