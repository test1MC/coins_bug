      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is set up to log you out automatically after a period of inactivity (the default is sixty minutes). All you need to do is log in again as normal. If the timeout period has passed, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> still displays the screen that you were last using, but the next time you try to do anything (for example, select a new menu item or open a record), you must log in, and <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will take you back to the last screen you were at.</p>
