    <h1 class="print">Standard House Types</h1>
    <p>Standard house types allow you to record information about the house types you build, and the specifications that belong to each house type. The specifications in turn determine which <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost heads" /> are used on plots of that house type.</p>
    <p>Standard house types are for house types that you will build on more than one <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vp site" />. (For <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vp sites" /> that have their own house types, you can set up <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vp site" />-specific house types.)</p>
    <p>Enter a separate record for each house type; if you are using non-sellable plots (for example, to allocate costs to roads, sewers, or the structural parts of a block of flats), you also need to set up at least one house type for non-sellable plots.</p>
