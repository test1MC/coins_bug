    <p>Future <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" /> are simplified <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> records that allow you to enter data for use in forecasting and business planning. They are not normally included in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> selections (on reports, etc.), but you can choose to include them. You cannot enter costs to a future <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />. </p>
    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> allows you to set up two types of future <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />. There is no difference between the two types other than the name (which you can configure); they are simply to allow you to group different future <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" /> together on the business plan. For example, you could use one type of future <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> for work that you know you are going to get, and the other type for work you are merely reasonably sure of getting. (For this second type, you may choose to only set up a single future <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> record, and record all business plan forecasts for 'likely work' against that.) </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Autonumbering future <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" /></strong>
    </p>
    <p>You can choose to number future <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" /> automatically, based on the value of one of various fields on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> record. </p>
