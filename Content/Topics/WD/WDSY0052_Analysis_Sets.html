            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Analysis Sets</h1>
        <p>Reports and browse screens give you various ways to sort and filter the records you're interested in.&#160; For example, you can sort and filter <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" /> records by account code, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> Registration Number, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.postal code" />, and so on.&#160; But these standard ways of sorting and filtering may not be adequate for your business needs.&#160; </p>
        <p>Analysis sets give you a way to set up additional fields on a record, which allow you to filter reports and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquiries" />, and arrange the information&#160; in a sequence other than the standard sequence. Using analysis sets, and depending on the characteristics of the reporting program, you can: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select which records to report on. </li>
            <li>Change the order records are listed in a report. </li>
            <li>Calculate subtotals by analysis set. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You need to set up the analysis sets for each module, to suit the needs of your business. You can do this by following the steps below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add an Analysis Set (includes Code, Description (Field Label), Start/End positions) to module configuration. See <a href="WDSY0053_Defining_Analysis_Sets.html">Defining Analysis Sets</a> and <a href="WDSY0054_Populating_Automatically.html">Populating Analysis Sets Automatically</a> for details on how to do this.</li>
            <li>Add Analysis Set Value Codes (includes Code and Description) for the analysis set to the appropriate analysis set maintenance procedure. See <a href="WDSY0055_Setting_Up_Codes.html">Setting Up Codes for Analysis Sets</a> for details on how to do this.</li>
            <li>If desired, add User Text to the side-frame help of the Description (Field Label) added in Step 1. This User Text will <strong>not</strong> be overridden when you upgrade <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. See <a href="WDSY0033_Customising_Help_Text.html">Custom<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ing Help Text</a> for details on how to do this.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you cannot produce the analysis you want using analysis sets, there are a number of alternatives which you should discuss with Construction Industry Solutions.</p>
