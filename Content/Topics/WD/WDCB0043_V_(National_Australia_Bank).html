    <h1 class="print">Format V (National Australia Bank)</h1>
    <p>Records are up to 80 characters long.  Fields are delimited with a comma (,); a slash (/) is used to delimit the last non-text field in a record if the statement line needs to be continued in a new record.</p>
    <p>Each record begins with a two-digit identifier:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first record in each 'logical file' for a customer begins with 01; the last record begins with 99.</li>
      <li>Within the 'logical file', the first record in each group (Originator/As-Of Date combination ) begins with 02; the last record begins with 98.</li>
      <li>Within each group, the first record in each account block begins with 03; the last record begins with 49.</li>
      <li>Transaction records begin with 16.</li>
      <li>Continuation records begin with 88.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> only imports record types 02, 03 and 16.</p>
