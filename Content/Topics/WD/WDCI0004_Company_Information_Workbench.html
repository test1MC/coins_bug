        <h1 class="print">Company Information Workbench</h1>
        <p>The Company Information Workbench is a database of all the companies you deal with; for example: <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" />, subcontractors, clients, architects, solicitors, and so on.&#160; The Company Information Workbench is "global" - that is, it is not restricted to a single <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> (kco).&#160; You should only have one record in the Company Information Workbench for each company you deal with.</p>
        <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
        <div class="note">Although company records are not specific to any <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />, your <a href="WDCI0003_User_View.html">user view</a> restricts which companies you see from any one <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />.</div>
        <p>Different modules have different versions of the CIW, which reflect the different needs.&#160; For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Procurement version of the workbench shows company scores and status, and allows you to dig deeper to information related to orders and accounts.</li>
            <li>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.marketing" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> version shows the contact and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.mk marketeer" />, and allows you to dig deeper to information related to projects and contacts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Company Types</h2>
        <p>Company types allow you to identify different types of company and your relationship with them. Each company in the Company Information Workbench belongs to one or more company type.&#160; For example, a company could be a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" />, subcontractor and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc hire" /> company.&#160; Each company type belongs to a module, which determines the views in which the company is visible.</p>
        <h2>Offices</h2>
        <p>Each company in the Company Information Workbench has one or more offices (for example, head office, regional offices and so on). When you create a new company record, this automatically creates an office record:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When you add a company in <span class="module">Procurement</span>, you specify the type of office you are entering (see <a href="WDPO0013_Adding_a_Company.html">Adding a New Company</a>)</li>
            <li>When you add a company in <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.marketing" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span>, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> creates a head office record (see <a href="WDMK0302_Adding_a_New_Company.html">Adding a new company (<MadCap:variable name="Variables.marketing" style="text-transform: capitalize;" />)</a>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After that, you can add other offices that belong to the same company.</p>
        <h2>Office Types</h2>
        <p>Office types allow you to identify different types of office; for example: head office, regional office.&#160; Each office has one type only.&#160; You must also define which office type you are using as a head office, using the CI parameter <span class="parameter">HOTYPE</span>.</p>
        <h2>Address Types</h2>
        <p>Each office can have many addresses - for example, a postal address, an address for deliveries, an address to which invoices should be sent, and so on.&#160; Address types identify the different types of address.</p>
        <p>There are specific address types for <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.purchase ledger" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span>, <span class="module">Subcontract Ledger</span>, <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.sales ledger" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span> invoices, and <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.sales ledger" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /></span> statements.</p>
