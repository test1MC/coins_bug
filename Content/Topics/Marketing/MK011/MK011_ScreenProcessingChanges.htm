COINS have another set of activity types, which are Journals (Tasks, Meetings) the screen for mapping and enabling activities of two systems should be provided.</p>
        <p class="Body" style="color: #ff0000;">Issues: we will need to map all kind of MS outlook activates (Meetings, Events, Appointments, except To Do) to single COINS Meeting type of appropriate Journal.</p>
        <p class="Body" style="color: #ff0000;">Or will need to be able to differentiate COINS Meetings by some additional Attribute or description. (see the screen below).</p>
