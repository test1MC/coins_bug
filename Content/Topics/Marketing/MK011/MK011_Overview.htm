        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1">Overview</h1>
        <p class="Body">The COINS system needed an integration solution with Microsoft© Outlook (MS) as an activities tracker and emailing client. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">New </MadCap:conditionalText>Add-On based functionality is <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">now </MadCap:conditionalText>available to add users with the ability to conveniently interact with data in MS Outlook and the COINS system (see Section <MadCap:xref href="#Add-On" class="Figurenumberonly"><i>1.1</i></MadCap:xref> below). This functionality allows COINS OA <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Marketing" /> and Project Management users to focus on their day to day work more efficiently via broader access and a more convenient way to access information in both COINS and MS Outlook.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1"><a name="Add-On"></a>Add-On Description</h2>
        <p class="Body">The <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>COINS&#160;MS&#160;Outlook Add-On provides integrated functional capabilities of the MS&#160;Outlook client and some COINS modules, especially <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Marketing" /> and Project Management. This Add-On is responsible for managing the synchron<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ization process (in both online and offline modes), as well as sending and receiving the data of two systems. It must be installed on a user’s workstation where an MS Outlook client is installed. Once installed, it adds new commands and menus to the MS Outlook user interface.</p>
        <p class="Body">When integrated, you can store references to e-mail messages sent and received from MS Outlook, as well as synchron<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />e the details of contact persons and activities between the two systems.</p>
        <p class="Body">A simplified image of the integration relationships between each system is shown in <MadCap:xref href="#COINSHighLevel" class="Figurenumberonly"><i>Figure 1</i></MadCap:xref>.</p>
