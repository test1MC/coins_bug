            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Overview</h1>
        <p>Before the Subcontract Ledger can be used, you need to enter key details about your subcontractors.&#160; You can add details of new subcontractors, or change the information about existing ones, at any time.</p>
        <p>Before you start, you will need to gather as much information about the subcontractor as possible, for example, address, telephone number, VAT codes, and contacts.&#160; You do not have to enter every field of information when you create the subcontractor file; some information can be added at a later date, but the more you have to start with the easier it will be to maintain the subcontractor file.</p>
        <p>New subcontractors are initially set up as companies in the Central Repository – This is covered in the guide HOW TO…Add a Company to the Central Repository (LMDCD0001)</p>
