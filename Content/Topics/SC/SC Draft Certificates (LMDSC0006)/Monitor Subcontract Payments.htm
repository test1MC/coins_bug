        <p>A Certificate will not appear as a cost until it has been posted by the Finance Department.&#160; Authorising a Certificate will not automatically post it.&#160; Although the Finance Department will monitor and post certificates regularly, it is good practise to monitor what Certificates are at what step in the process. </p>
        <p>This section will demonstrate how to monitor a Subcontract Draft Certificate.</p>
