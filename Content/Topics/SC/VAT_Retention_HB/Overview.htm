        <p>Changes have been made to correctly handle the calculation of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> after retention on subcontractor payments where there is a split <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> analysis from VAP. The standard certificate definition has been updated to allow for this, and manual update of the calculated values is now prevented.</p>
        <p>An additional change allows CITB&#160;accruals and training cost recoveries to be handled based on payments net of tax rather than <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour" />-only payments.</p>
        <h2>Background to the Changes</h2>
        <p>HMRC has clarified that a self-billing invoice or authenticated receipt cannot create a tax point for the retention amount until that retention is paid. This means that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> on these payments must be calculated after the retention, and additional processing by <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is needed to ensure that the correct <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> treatment is applied to each release of retention.</p>
        <h2>Action Required</h2>
        <p>Contractors should not need to make any changes to configuration as a result of these enhancements. Home builders who pay subcontractors through self-billing or authenticated receipts need to check existing configuration and may need to configure new certificate definitions. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Vat caps" /> invoices are not affected.</p>
