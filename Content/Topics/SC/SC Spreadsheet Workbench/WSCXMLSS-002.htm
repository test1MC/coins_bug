        <h1>Creating a Payment</h1>
        <p>Navigate to <span class="Function">Subcontract Ledger &gt; Certificates &gt; Spreadsheet Workbench</span></p>

        </p>
        <p>Find the subcontract order you need from the list (use the search function).</p>
        <p>Tick the subcontract you need.</p>
        <p>Select ‘Generate Payment Spreadsheet’.</p>
        <p>Click ‘Apply Action’ </p>
        <p>Once you have selected the payment you wish to generate the download process will commence (this will take a few minutes per payment) and once complete the latest payment certificate will appear in the ‘Download Spreadsheet’ Tab as below. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You can generate more than one spreadsheet at once. However, remember the more you generate in a single batch the longer it will take before you can start using them.</p>
        <p>Consider starting the generating process in advance of when you need them e.g. at the end of the working day before you switch off. They will continue to generate and will be available to you the following morning.</p>
        <p>Right click on the XML Spreadsheet only – do not use the Compressed File.</p>
        <p>Select ‘Save Target As…’</p>
        <p>Save the payment certificate where you would normally save your payment files, i.e. a shared drive or a local folder on your PC (ensuring it is saved as an ‘XML file’).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">DO NOT CHANGE THE FILE NAME (if you do the upload will fail).</p>
