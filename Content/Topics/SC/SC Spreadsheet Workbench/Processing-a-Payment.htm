        <p>This section can only be completed by an authorised input clerk.

</p>
        <p>Once the payment spreadsheet has been completed and deposited in the regions folder for payments ready for upload and the authorisation has been signed-off, the payment can be uploaded into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.

</p>
        <p>The input clerk MUST open each workbook check that the content matches the authorised payment sheet and save the file back to the folder.
</p>
        <p>
