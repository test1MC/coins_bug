            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Cancel SC Certificates</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There may be a requirement to cancel a SC Certificate even though it has been posted to the ledger. However:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Certificates generated from any external link to the SC Ledger e.g. VAP, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Commercial Manager caps" />, etc. cannot be cancelled with this routine (Draft Certificates are OK).</li>
            <li>Users will be unable to cancel a certificate that has a newer transaction associated with the same order.</li>
            <li>Only the last unpaid posted certificate related to the subcontract can be cancelled due to the complexities of cumulative values. Nevertheless you can go back cancelling previous unpaid certificates one after the other to get back to the one you want to cancel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Status field will show “Cancelled” against the original transaction and “Cancelled” on the cancelling transaction.</p>
