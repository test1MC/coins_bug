For this reason the new scheme is                 sometimes referred to by Revenue as eRCT.                 The RCT scheme aims to improve compliance among subcontractors in the construction industry by                 ensuring that payments from principal contractors to subcontractors are notified to Revenue, and that tax is                 deducted at source where appropriate.                  Under eRCT, there are three key processes: Contract Notification, Payment Notification and the RCT                 Return.  There are additional processes to handle amendments, cancellations, etc.                                                                           © Construction Industry Solutions 2013","RCT                    Contract Notification                 The first key process is Contract Notification (this replaces the old RCT1 and RCT46).  All Relevant Contracts                 must be notified electronically to Revenue before any payments are made. This can either be done directly                 online using ROS or using third party software such as COINS.  Within COINS, this will be required for each                 subcontract record before certificates on that subcontract can be selected for payment.            Payment Notification                 The second key process is Payment Notification (this replaces the old RCT 47 and RCT48).  All proposed                 payments on Relevant Contracts must be notified electronically to Revenue before they are made.  On                 receipt of the Payment Notification, Revenue will advise the Principal of the amount of tax to be deducted                 from the payment, if any.  This can either be done directly online using ROS or using third party software                 such as COINS.  Note that because Revenue will calculate the amount of tax to be deducted there is no                 definite requirement for the Principal to keep a record of the rate of deduction to be used for a                 subcontractor, although it may be advisable to do so.           RCT Return                 The third key process is the RCT Return (this replaces the old RCT30 and RCT35).  This is an electronic return                 of payments made on Relevant Contracts which will be processed either monthly or quarterly depending on                 the filing frequency of the Principal.  The draft return (also known as 'Deduction Summary') will be produced                 by Revenue based on the Payment Notifications received during the period.  This will need to be checked by                 the Principal and any amendments made either directly online using ROS or using third party software such                 as COINS.           Tax Rates                  There are three tax deduction rates: 0%, 20%, and 35%. Subcontractors who satisfy the previous criteria for                 a C2 card will qualify for the 0% rate. In certain limited cases, subcontractors will be placed at 35% (for                 example, subcontractors who are not registered with Revenue or where there are serious compliance issues                 to be addressed). All other subcontractors are eligible for the standard 20% rate.                                                   © Construction Industry Solutions 2013","RCT                    2 Official Sources of Information on the New eRCT                   Scheme                  The published information from Revenue concerning the RCT changes is available from the following area                 on their website: http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/rct/principal­contractors.html.

Download a ZIP file containing the required files from the client area of the COINS website.                    2. A Java runtime minimum version 1.6.0_21 must be available on the COINS server.  Set the value of                       the new SCIRE parameter JAVAHOME to the location of the \"bin\" directory under this Java runtime.                       Typically this will be /usr/java/jre1.6.0_26/bin.                     3. Load the ros_root.crt file to the keystore:                          1. Copy ros_root.crt to the server using binary FTP, not necessarily but usually, to $DLC/certs.                           2. Set environment variable $DLC to be the location of version 10.2b of Progress,                             (typically /usr/opt/dlc/v102b)                           3. Load the certificate to the keystore using this command line:                                 cd $DLC/certs;$DLC/bin/mkhashfile ros_root.crt                          4.

The client security p12 file (for example, YourName.p12) must be available in $BASE/var/IERCT/wsdl.                    7. Copy the webservice WSDL file (rct.wsdl) to $BASE/var/IERCT/wsdl.                     8. Copy the COINS Java class program (IEROSDigitalSigner.class) to $BASE/var/IERCT/java.                    9. You also need to set parameters to reflect this configuration; see Irish Subcontractor Tax Parameters.                             NOTE                            All files copied in 6, 7 and 8 above should have rw­rw­rw­ (666) permissions. If FTP'ed, this                            must be done using BINARY mode.                        © Construction Industry Solutions 2013","RCT                    Communication with Revenue                 To prove that your COINS system is able to communicate with the Revenue systems, you need to run the                 Townshend test.

If the subcontractor does not have an Irish tax                             reference, leave this blank and tick the No Irish Tax Reference box. You will then need to fill                             in the foreign tax reference details and various other fields depending on the business type of                             the subcontractor.

To update the RCT details of existing subcontractors, you can also use Subcontract Ledger > Administration >                 Subcontractor RCT Details Review/Update (see eRCT ­ Updating Old Subcontractors).              5.2 Ongoing Contracts                  Some subcontractors are treated for RCT purposes as operating under a single ongoing contract even                 though they work across a number of different sites.  For these subcontractors, you only need to register                 one contract with Revenue even though, on COINS, there may be a number of separate subcontracts and/or                 orders. (This is the case if the terms and conditions for each subcontract or order are the same, and the                 subcontractor is not re­tendering for the work.                  In v10.22 and v10.23 of COINS, for subcontractors with ongoing contracts you would enter the default                 contract registration details against the subcontractor record.  These were then copied to each new                 subcontract, order and invoice, and there were actions to copy the details from the subcontractor to                 existing subcontracts.  If such a subcontractor had to have a separate subcontract registered with Revenue,                 you could override the default contract registration details on any subcontract, order or invoice.                  This caused difficulties, however, if the details of the ongoing contract changed, so from COINS v10.25                 onwards, the details of ongoing contracts are only held on the subcontractor record; subcontract records                 simply have a tickbox to indicate whether the subcontract belongs to the ongoing contract.                       NOTE                      As part of the upgrade process to v10.25, for any subcontractor with an ongoing contract, all                      subcontracts with the same Contract ID as the ongoing Contract ID have the new ongoing tickbox                      ticked and the Contract ID removed.  These will then make them consistent with any new                      subcontracts entered after the upgrade on subcontractors with an ongoing contract. See                      Electronic Contract Notification.               5.3 eRCT ­ Updating Old Subcontractors                   If you have old subcontract records you need to update with RCT details, you can use Subcontract Ledger >                 Administration > Subcontractor RCT Details Review/Update.  This includes facilities to copy existing VAT or                 C2 reference numbers into the RCT Tax Reference field, as well as allowing you to review the details                 relating to RCT for subcontractors at a glance.

Configuration                  Any subcontract record which is not a Relevant Contract (but which is for an RCT registered                  subcontractor) would need to be flagged as such by setting the RCT-able field to N: this will then allow                  payments on that subcontract without following RCT rules in the same way as for a subcontractor who                  has the tax scheme set as X for exempt. (To display the RCT-able field, the SC parameter SBSTAX needs to                  be set to Y, and the SY parameter TERMCODE needs to be set to %IRE.)

Electronic contract notification submits this notification electronically, and updates the relevant                 information in COINS. Within COINS, a relevant contract could be represented by:                      • A subcontract record.                    • A subcontract order or purchase order.             © Construction Industry Solutions 2013","RCT                             • An ongoing contract, recorded on the subcontractor record.                     To submit contract notifications electronically:                            1. Go to Subcontract Ledger > Contract Notification Workbench.                             The Current tab shows notification records that have not yet been submitted or have recently                             been submitted. To begin with, the Status column shows Incomplete for new notification                             records.                                                       2. To see what information a notification record still needs, click   ; any incomplete or invalid                             data will be highlighted.                          3. Update the record and complete the contract details: this is likely to be necessary for all new                             contract notifications in order to answer the questions required by Revenue.  The questions                             are dependent on whether the subcontractor has an Irish Tax Reference and whether it is a                             Labour Only contract or not.                              The Status column shows Ready if all the information is valid.                          4. Select the notification record or records you want to submit, choose the Submit to Revenue                             action, and click   .

COINS submits to Revenue any records with a status of Ready.

There is a legal requirement to notify Revenue                 of any proposed payment to be made under a Relevant Contract before making any such payment.  On                 receipt of the Payment Notification, Revenue will advise the Principal of the amount of tax to be deducted                 from the payment, if any.

For each notified payment,                       COINS then automatically updates the certificate with the authorisation details received from                       Revenue.

You cannot get authorisation for a negative item, so you may need                       to adjust the RCT Return to offset the negative certificate against positive certificates for the same                       subcontractor.                    • Internal transfers with a positive payment certificate on one contract and an equal negative payment                       certificate on another.

COINS provides an override facility to print cheques and remittances, and create a EFT/BACS file which                 includes transactions not authorised by Revenue.                     1. First, contact Revenue to check whether the circumstances justify use of the override.                     2. Contact the COINS support desk and request them to apply the override.                    3. After printing the cheques or generating the EFT/BACS file, do not post the payment batch.

To submit the cancellation requests:                           1. Go to Subcontract Ledger > Payments > Cancel Notifications and find the last batch which is                             not posted. This batch may have status \"Unposted\" or \"Posting\".                                       The transactions in this batch correspond to the certificate notifications that have been                             selected for cancellation.                          2.

COINS validates the batch and checks that the deduction authorisations to which the                             cancellation requests relate will not expire within the next 23 days (that is, that they are within                             the current return period).  If the batch passes the validation, COINS submits the cancellation                             requests to Revenue electronically.

As with subcontract certificates, these need to be entered, posted and selected for                 payment before you process the Payment Notification.                 When you enter invoices with a subcontract labour element, COINS will issue the following warnings:                     • If the subcontractor account linked to the supplier does not have a valid Tax Reference, you will be                       able to enter the invoice but COINS will warn you that you must enter the Tax Reference against the                       subcontractor before you can pay the invoice.                     • If there is a contract notification end date against the order, or the linked subcontractor record has an                       ongoing contract notification end date, then:                 © Construction Industry Solutions 2013","RCT                                    ◦ If the date is in the past but within the last six calendar months, COINS warns you that the                             invoice must be paid within six months of the end date, or the Contract Notification must be                             updated.                            ◦ If the date is more than six months in the past, COINS either warns you that the invoice cannot                             be paid unless the notification end date is amended, or prevents you entering the invoice                             (depending on the setting of SCIRE/STOPUNPO).            Invoices with No Purchase Order                 No information about the Contract Notification will have been stored in COINS unless the subcontractor has                 on ongoing contract, details of which are stored against the subcontractor.  You must check the Contract                 Notification details manually and input, on the Labour tab of the invoice, the necessary information (the                 Contract ID and optionally the End Date) for the Payment Notification to be processed by COINS, unless                 details of the ongoing contract have been defaulted in and do not need to be over­ridden.           Invoices against a COINS Purchase Order                 If the supplier account of the company/office selected is linked to a subcontractor account as a supplier of                 subcontract labour, you can configure COINS to create a record on the Subcontract Ledger > Contract                 Notification Workbench (for electronic submission) on commitment of the order or you can enter the basic                 details of the Contract Notification (Contract ID and End Date) either:                     • On the order header (see Manual Contract Notification for Suppliers).                    • Against an invoice, in which case COINS copies the details to the order.                  The registration details are then defaulted in for any future invoices against that order.            Selecting Invoices for Payment                 If you select invoices for payment that fall within the scope of RCT, but for which either the Contract ID is                 not recorded, or the Contract Notification has expired, those invoices cannot be paid.                 If you are using Manual Payment Selection, the warning/error will appear on screen; if you are using Batch                 Payment Selection the warning/error will be shown in the report.                 If there are invoices you are unable to select, you need to use Amend Invoices to add the missing contract                 notification details and then re­select the invoices for payment.                  See Selecting Invoices for Payment; the process is very similar to that used for subcontractors.

Amending Posted Invoices                 During Payment Notification, the Contract ID is validated by Revenue.  If the response shows that the                 Contract ID has been input incorrectly, you need to input the correct Contract ID.                 You also need to input the Contract ID for invoices that were input prior to the introduction of eRCT, but are                 paid under eRCT.

This is an electronic return of payments made on Relevant Contracts which                 will be processed either monthly or quarterly depending on the filing frequency of the principal.  Revenue                 produces a draft RCT Return (known as a Deduction Summary) based on the Payment Notifications received                 during the period.                 You can obtain the draft return from ROS after the end of the period.  If you do not correct this by the 23rd                 of the following month, it will be deemed to be correct; therefore you need to check this and notify                 Revenue of any amendments.                     • You need to ensure that there are no unallocated payments in Subcontract Ledger or Purchase Ledger                       before attempting to reconcile the Return.                    • If you notified payments to Revenue, but did not actually make them and have not notified Revenue                       that you did not make them, you need to remove them from the Return.                    • If you made any payments that are not included on the Return, you need to add them to the Return.                     • If you notified payments before the end of the month, but made them after the end of the month,                       you can defer them until the next return.  Only do this if you have actually made the payment after                       the end of the month, as once you have deferred a payment, you cannot cancel it.

You can only do this after the end date of the return period; the return period is either a calendar                 month or a calendar quarter (ending on the last day of March, June, September or December), as instructed                 by Revenue.                 If all payment notifications are complete and correct, and the information on COINS agrees with that held                 by Revenue, you may not need to do anything further; Revenue will treat the deduction summary as the                 completed return.                     To start the RCT return process:                     1. Go to Subcontract Ledger > Payments > Return Reconciliation Workbench.                    2. Add a new return record and select the end date of the period the return applies to.                        If you are creating a return for a previous period, COINS displays a message to warn you that the                       return has already been finalised.                     3. Leave the Automatically Request Deduction Summary box ticked.                    4. When you save the record, COINS submits an electronic request to Revenue for the deduction                       summary.  The request may take some time to complete.  During this process the request can have                       one of the following stages:                           ◦ New  ­ This is the initial stage of the record when first created, and should only be transitory                             unless there is a communication problem with Revenue.                           ◦ Requested  ­ The deduction summary has been requested from Revenue but not received.                             > If the record remains at this stage because no response has been received from Revenue,                             select the record and use the Request Deduction Summary action to resubmit the request.                           ◦ Request Error  ­ The deduction summary has been requested from Revenue but an error                             response has been received or the detail records received do not agree with the header                             received.                             > The underlying error will need to be resolved and then you need to cancel the return                             header record  (see Cancelling an RCT Return) and create a new one for the same period.             © Construction Industry Solutions 2013","RCT                                    ◦ Processing  ­ The deduction summary has been received from Revenue and COINS is                             processing the response.

Go to Subcontract Ledger > Payments > Return Reconciliation Workbench.                    2. Click the link on the return you want to reconcile.                     3. On the Return Details tab, review the return detail records. These are the payment notification                       records as received from Revenue.  The Matching Status field shows whether the return detail record                       has been matched to COINS payment records.                                © Construction Industry Solutions 2013","RCT                                    ◦ If the Matching Status is Matched, you do not need to do anything.                           ◦ If the Matching Status is Delayed Match, you need to accept the record in the current period,                             or carry it forward to the next period.                           ◦ If the Matching Status is Partially Matched, you can manually match additional COINS                             payment records to the return record.  Alternatively you can amend the values on the                             return, accept the amounts on the return, or unmatch the payment record(s).                           ◦ If the Matching Status is Unmatched, you need to manually match it to one or more COINS                             payment records, or cancel the return detail record.  (Alternatively you can accept the values                             on the return, which implies that you have made the payment as indicated on the return, but                             not recorded it in COINS.)                     4. To make any changes, click the link in the Int Ref column.                       COINS displays the return details.  The Matched tab shows the COINS payment records that have                       been matched to the selected return record.

The                 most likely reason for there being such unmatched records is negative certificates, for which you cannot                 make payment notifications.                     To review and clear unmatched payments:                      1. Go to Subcontract Ledger > Payments > Return Reconciliation Workbench.                    2. Click the link on the return you want to reconcile.                    3. On the COINS Details tab, review the return detail records.  You can set the filter to Unmatched to                       show any unmatched payments.                    4.

Choose Ignore from the action menu.                           ◦ If there are payment records with equal positive and negative values:                                 1. Select both records.                                2. Choose Ignore from the action menu.                            ◦ If there is a negative payment record with no corresponding positive transaction:                                1. Select the record.                                2. Choose Offset from the action menu.  COINS displays a list of transactions for the same                                   subcontractor.                                3. Select a record to offset the negative payment against (this must have a positive value                                   equal to or greater than the negative value of the negative payment record).               8.5 Submitting Amendments to an RCT Return                  When the reconciliation is complete, if you have made any amendments to the deduction summary records,                 the Stage field in Subcontract Ledger > Payments > Return Reconciliation Workbench shows Data Ready;                 this means the reconciliation is complete but there are items within the return which have been flagged as                 Add, Amend, Cancel or Carry Forward.  You need to submit the amendments electronically to Revenue.                     To submit amendments to a return:                      1. Go to Subcontract Ledger > Payments > Return Reconciliation Workbench.                    2.
