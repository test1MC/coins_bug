        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This is achieved by committing SC Order for ‘onboarded’ Subcontractor. Once an Order is Published it is visible on the All SC Orders Screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SC/SC-Controller/Application User Process_2.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>User can right click on an SC Order line and the following options will appear:</p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SC/SC-Controller/Application User Process_3.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Assign to Me – Assigns the Order to you so it appears in your ‘My SC Orders’ grid so it can be worked on.</p>
        <p>Assign to allow users to assign to another SC controller user:</p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SC/SC-Controller/Application User Process_4.png" class="FullWidth" /> </p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The SC Order Statuses should be as follows:</p>
        <p>• Unenhanced and Enhanced Orders – New</p>
        <p>• Once Order has been ‘shared’ with Subcontractor then - Active</p>
        <p>• Once Order Value has been fully applied against and or OA deems the Order complete status - Closed</p>
        <p>• If Order is Cancelled in OA then this status is published from OA to SC Portal then status - Cancelled</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.3 ">Enhance SC Order</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In the My SC Orders Screen:</p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SC/SC-Controller/Application User Process_6.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The right click menu on a New SC Order brings up the following options View and Enhance. </p>
        <p>View – read only of details held against SC order</p>
        <p>Enhance – Ability to add details to the Order including Contract Type and Valuation Dates.</p>
        <p>Clicking Enhance brings up the following screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SC/SC-Controller/Application User Process_7.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Users can then ADD Valuation Dates by clicking in the grid </p>
