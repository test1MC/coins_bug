        <h1>Your Construction Cloud Desktop</h1>
        <p>The COINS Construction Cloud workspace consists of a Desktop that contains tiles from which you can run a selection of functions and/or see information. There are also one or more other tabs (for example, SC&#160;Controller), which have menus from which you can run all the functions that are assigned to you.</p>
        <h2>Set Up Your Desktop</h2>
        <p>When you first log in to COINS Construction Cloud, your Desktop shows in Edit Mode. Using Edit Mode, you can set up the tiles on your Desktop.</p>
