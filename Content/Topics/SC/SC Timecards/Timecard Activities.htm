            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Timecard Activities</h1>
        <p>If some subcontractors are paid on a timecard basis, you need to define the possible types of activity. Timecards can be used for entering any type of measured work (for example, metres of work completed), not just for "hours worked" jobs.</p>
        <p>Timecard Activities are setup in <b>Subcontract Ledger &gt; Setup Maintenance &gt; Subcontract Timecard Activities</b></p>

        </p>
        <p>For each Activity you need to have the following.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Activity Code</li>
            <li>Description</li>
            <li>Unit</li>
            <li>Analysis will be where you want the costs to go for each type of activity, it will need to be setup with a '..' before the cost code so that any contract can be used. <br />For example, if the default analysis for this activity is to be cost head S100 and cost category S, without specifying contract or phase, enter ..S100.S Then if this activity is used on contract 1000, section 2, the resulting analysis would be 1000.2.S100.S; if it is used on contract 2000 (a contract which does not use WBS), the analysis would be 2000. S100.S.<br /></li>
            <li>The Item IDs for the lines in the Subcontractor Certificate Definition to which the timecard costs will be entered.</li>
        </ul>
