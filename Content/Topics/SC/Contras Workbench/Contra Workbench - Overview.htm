            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Contra Workbench - Overview</h1>
        <p class="Body">A new <span class="Function">Contra Workbench</span> caters for all regions and allows recovery of costs linked to filtered cost transactions. The filtered transactions will be marked as unallocated with the ability to match these to other transactions or link to a contra (on which you can adjust the recovery amount and optionally add an administration charge) and then recover via a sales invoice. <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /></span> and <span class="module">Subcontract Ledger</span> payment runs now allow you to automatically offset these sales invoices against the payment.</p>
        <p class="Body">The approach of using a sales invoice has been adopted for two reasons: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>To ensure the correct handling of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> on contra charges.</li>
            <li>To ensure that contra charges can be recovered against <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /></span> and <span class="module">Subcontract Ledger</span> payments, while avoiding problems with the sequence in which subcontractor certificates are posted, approved and selected for payment.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Body">This new functionality does not require <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Commercial Manager caps" /></span>.</p>
