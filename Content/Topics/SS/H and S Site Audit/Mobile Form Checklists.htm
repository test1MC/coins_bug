        <p class="Body">Checklists allow you to set up a list of possible statements or answers to a question, from which the user would pick the ones that apply.</p>
        <p class="Body">For example, if you are scoring “Working at Height” you can define a checklist of the policies you have on this. When marking, users would enter or select a score, and would see a list of items that relate to that score. They can select from the list rather than having to type long-hand. </p>
