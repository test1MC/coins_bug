        <p class="Body">H&amp;S Audits can be input using a mobile device (a Windows tablet app is available – others may come) or using OA. Mobile is better suited for site safety inspection type audits, with the ability to capture details as the audit is done and to photograph the issues.&#160; </p>
        <p class="Body">Audits can trigger workflows, either via user selection or automatically on completion. Audits can automatically generate a PDF and circulate it by email to the concerned parties. You can build business logic in to this <MadCap:variable name="Variables.behaviour" /> – for example, dynamically add people to the email circulation list based on the score, or trigger different workflows based on score.</p>
        <p class="Body">The Audits are configurable forms and can be used for more than just audits. For example you could set up a register of contact with your national Health and Safety body – recording when they inspect your sites, or any reviews of your procedures.</p>
        <p class="Body">The Action Monitor allows you to view the actions arising from audit workflows. You can record if an action is with a person outside of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.&#160; You can email third parties – Central Repository Contacts or Personnel – regarding the action, using a template and selecting which images to attach from the audit. There is a process to send chase emails if the third parties haven’t responded.</p>
