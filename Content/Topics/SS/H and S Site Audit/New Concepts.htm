        <p class="Body">Fields on mobile forms are keyed on which form, section, and row they are on, plus their position within the sequence of fields.&#160; A new concept in mobile forms is a “field ID” which means you can give your own more meaningful ID to a field.&#160; This ID can be used on the form in the calculations, and can be used for statistical reporting.&#160; If you have corresponding fields on different audit forms, you can use the same ID on multiple forms, to allow you to produce consolidated reports.</p>
