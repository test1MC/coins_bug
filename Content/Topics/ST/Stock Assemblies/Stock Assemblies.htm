        <p class="Body"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.st stock" style="text-transform: capitalize;" /> assemblies allow you to combine <MadCap:variable name="Variables.st stock" /> items as components that can be issued for on-site assembly or assembled to create a different item. The assemblies can be ordered as quantities of a single item, then issued and charged either as a whole or as individual components.</p>
        <p class="Body">For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple issue of the components required for on-site assembly, so a length of single-sided 6.5 foot <MadCap:variable name="Variables.centre" /> guardrail can be requested, and all the parts required calculated and issued automatically.</li>
            <li>Assembly of components to create a different item.  An item like a stop sign could be held in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.st stock" /> or assembled from other items (pole, supports, bolts, and stop sign panel).</li>
            <li>Concrete or tarmac/asphalt, where the constituents are held separately and only combined when required. </li>
            <li>Items that can be split; for example you may issue safety goggles in boxed quantity or individually.</li>
        </ul>
