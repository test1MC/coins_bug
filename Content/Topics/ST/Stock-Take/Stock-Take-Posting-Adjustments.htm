        <p>When the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Stock Take caps" /> is completed, whether adjustments were needed or not, or whether amendments were done line by line or by bulk methods, the batch will need posting. The posting can be done from either the main <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Stock Take caps" /> screen or within the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Stock Take caps" /> batch itself.</p>
        <p>From the main screen select the batch (<MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the box) select Post from the action menu and click the Apply Action button<MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_ApplyAction.flsnp" /></p>
