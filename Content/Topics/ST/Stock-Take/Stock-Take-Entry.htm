        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Stock Take Entry allows you to enter adjustments to stock balances, with associated financial adjustments. </p>
        <p class="note">A Stock Take Batch must first be created before entries are made here.</p>
        <p>A Stock take confirms that the stock level for a particular stock item is either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Same</li>
            <li>Is less</li>
            <li>Is more</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To apply adjustments go to the Stock Take Entry page in the ‘Input’ folder.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>It is important to be aware that the Stock Take batch is incomplete and unposted until adjustments are confirmed.</p>
        <p>Please note - Unwanted batches such as those created in error should still be posted/completed (even if no adjustments are needed) as unposted transactions can cause problems at month-end.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Clicking on the adjacent Open folder allows the header details to be amended – for example the Description may need changing. </p>

        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Filters</h2>
        <p>A number of filters are available to enable various searches to be made on the Stock Take Sheet, for example the Bin number (if used) or the Stock item code or the item description.</p>
        <p>Other filters can help whilst making the adjustments to categorise the results – for example there is a filter to show all items that have been changed to show more items than expected (highlighted above and below). To activate these filters select one and click on the ‘Apply Filler’ button.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Zero Count – This filter shows stock items with zero quantity</p>
        <p>Not As Expected - This filter shows items that have been adjusted to be more or less.</p>
        <p>Less Than Expected - This filter shows items that have been adjusted to be less than expected.</p>
        <p>More Than Expected - This filter shows items that have been adjusted to be more than expected.</p>
