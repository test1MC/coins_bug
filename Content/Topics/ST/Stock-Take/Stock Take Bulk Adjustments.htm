            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" /><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Stock Take caps" /> Entry- Bulk Adjustments</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If a large amount of adjustments are required then it may be more efficient to do a bulk update.</p>
        <p>To do this a Bulk export of the selection is required to amend and then upload back into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Selecting the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.St Stock caps" /> items for Export</h2>
        <p>Everything can be exported by simply clicking on the Bulk <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> box and the Open icon (see next section). However it is likely that you may want to update smaller groups of items in separate batches.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that the export function will dump whatever selection has been made in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, for example if a group of items has been selected then only those items will be exported.</p>
        <p>You can choose specific <MadCap:variable name="Variables.st stock" /> items by ticking the Select tick box adjacent. Holding down the ‘ctrl’ key, whilst clicking the items, allows for specific groups to be selected.</p>
        <p>In the example below 2 items have been selected via the ‘ctrl’ and clicking option. </p>

        </p>
        <p>To only view the selected lines from the screen click the browse control and click Show Selected.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Exporting</h2>
        <p>To export the selected records, click <img style="width: 72px;height: 32px;" src="../../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/Icons 1105/Bulk_1105.png" /> and then click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Open_Both.flsnp" /></p>
        <p>In the example above clicking the Bulk and Open icons would export the 2 items selected.</p>
        <p>When exporting a new <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> page appears along with a message to confirm the export. This new page is used to paste the adjusted stock figures into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> – at this point ignore the page as the adjustments need to be collated first.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Page presented awaiting bulk adjustments to be copied in:</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The export creates a dump of data into an Excel window.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/ST/Stock-Take/Stock-Take_24_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Make all the adjustments into the ‘Count’ column with the figures provided from the Yardsperson (see example below).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/ST/Stock-Take/Stock-Take_25_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Once the amendments are entered onto the spreadsheet, copy all of the data including the header row and the last two columns. Do not copy blank rows underneath. In the example above rows 1 to 3 are highlighted and copied.</p>
        <p>Please note that if the "Count" column is left empty for Stock Items and the batch is posted, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> understands blank to mean zero and as such, will automatically do an adjustment (if required) to bring the count to zero.</p>
        <p>Go to the blank <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> bulk screen generated earlier - click into the white blank box area and paste (right click). The adjustment figures will then appear into the white box.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button_Save_Both.flsnp" /></p>
        <p>The bulk process applies the changes from the spreadsheet.</p>
