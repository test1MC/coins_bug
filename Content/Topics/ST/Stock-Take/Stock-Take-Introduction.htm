        <h1>Stock Take Overview</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Performing a Stock Take is usually done as a periodical process to define current stock levels and stock value in an organisation. The process often precludes the financial year-end process. For example, where the financial year ends on December 31 - the Stock Take would be done in late November.
A full or part Stock Take may also be necessary in order to resolve any stocking issues that arise throughout the year.
It is worth noting that adjustments to amounts can also be done per stock item via the standard Stock Transaction type - ‘A-Stock Adjustment’.
