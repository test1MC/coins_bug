            <li>The Same</li>
            <li>Is less</li>
            <li>Is more</li>

        <h2>Filters</h2>
        <p>A number of filters are available to enable various searches to be made on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Stock Take caps" /> Sheet, for example the Bin number (if used) or the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.St Stock caps" /> item code or the item description.</p>
        <p>Other filters can help whilst making the adjustments to categorise the results – for example there is a filter to show all items that have been changed to show more items than expected (highlighted above and below). To activate these filters select one and click on the ‘Apply Filler’ button.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
