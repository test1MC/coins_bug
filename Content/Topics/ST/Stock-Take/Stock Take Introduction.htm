        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Performing a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Stock Take caps" /> is usually done as a periodical process to update current <MadCap:variable name="Variables.st stock" /> levels and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.st stock" />value in an organ<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation. The process often precludes the financial year-end process. For example, where the financial year ends on December 31 - the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Stock Take caps" /> would be done in late November.
A full or part <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Stock Take caps" />may also be necessary in order to resolve any stocking issues that arise throughout the year.
It is worth noting that adjustments to amounts can also be done per stock item via the standard <MadCap:variable name="Variables.St Stock caps" /> Transaction type - ‘A-<MadCap:variable name="Variables.St Stock caps" /> Adjustment’.
