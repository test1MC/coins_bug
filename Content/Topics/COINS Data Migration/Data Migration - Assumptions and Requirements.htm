        <h1>Data Migration - Assumptions and Requirements</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> have assumed that in order to carry out the data transfer that the following actions will have been carried out by the client.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
Configuration and parameter settings have been agreed and signed off.
</li>
            <li>Other setup tables are in place, such as Transaction Types, Budget Types, Memo Data Types, etc.
</li>
            <li>Coding structures such as:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>General Ledger codes
</li><li>Contract Status <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cost Heads caps" /> and any Sections and Activities
</li><li>Procurement Commodities, Trades, Labour Codes and Plant items
</li><li>Payroll Pay Items
</li></ol></li>
        </ul>
        <p>have been agreed, signed off and in place.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
Forms for printing P/L Remittances, S/C certificates/Remittances, Sales Ledger Invoices/Statements, Purchase Orders, etc. have been configured.
</li>
            <li>The initial checking and subsequent full reconciliation of the data to be transferred.</li>
            <li>
The signing off of the data transfer as fully reconciled by the client and that they accept full responsibility for the reconciliation, prior to any live <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> transactions being entered onto the environment.
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any transactional data load will require a process to ensure that all loaded data reconciles. There must be controls in place that demonstrate that the data loaded agrees with the data from the legacy system.</p>
