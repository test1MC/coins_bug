        <p class="Body">New features allow you to configure appraisals to report on cost flow and cash flow separately based on assumptions about the relationship between cost movements and cash movements.</p>
        <p class="Body">Another new feature allows you to calculate a percentage profit contingency on each plot. This can be recovered against WIP at legal completion and released after 12 months or when the last plot on the development is legally completed.</p>
