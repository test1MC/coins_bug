        <p class="Body">The Overhead Order and Overhead GRN workbenches (both Live and "Including Archived" versions) now take the user's overhead department security settings into account. If the user does not have access to the overhead department held on the purchase order header screen, the order and any related GRNs will not appear in any of these workbenches. </p>
