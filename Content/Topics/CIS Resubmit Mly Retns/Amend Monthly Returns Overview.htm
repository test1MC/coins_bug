        <p class="Body">To allow resubmission of CIS returns which need to be amended as a result of refunds, cancelled payments or accounting adjustments/corrections since the return was originally submitted, a nominated user can now take a copy of a previous CIS Return and amend figures in it before resubmitting it. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Documents.ReleaseOverview">See <a href="https://www.coins-global.com/storage/documents/OA-CE-SC009-AmendResubmitCISMonthlyReturns-UK.pdf" target="_blank">OA-CE-SC009</a> for details.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="Documents.NotReleaseOverview" MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Background</h2>
        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="Documents.NotReleaseOverview">In the UK, HMRC requires monthly submissions of CIS returns listing the subcontractors paid during the tax month, together with the Total Payments, Cost of Materials and Tax Deducted for each subcontractor paid during the month.
</p>
        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="Documents.NotReleaseOverview">Where refunds, cancelled payments or accounting adjustments/corrections result in any of the three figures to be returned for a subcontractor becoming negative, the negative figure cannot be included in the return, because HMRC systems will not accept negative figures.  </p>
        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="Documents.NotReleaseOverview">From April 2016, adjustments have to be made electronically by resubmitting the whole of the earlier return against which the adjustments need to be offset.  If any of the three figures was negative, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> would submit the negative figure as zero and submit the rest of the entry as normal.  HMRC then does not require immediate reporting of adjustments to Payment or Materials figures – they simply require that the contractor retains the figures and provides them to HMRC if requested. </p>
        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="Documents.NotReleaseOverview"> However if the adjustment is to the tax figure this needs to be reported to HMRC so that the CIS Returns agree to the tax paid over to HMRC.  This PDR addresses this issue.</p>
        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="Documents.NotReleaseOverview">The approach is to allow a suitable user to take a copy of a previous CIS Return and then to amend figures in it before resubmitting it. </p>
        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="Documents.NotReleaseOverview"><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> does not attempt to ensure that the adjustments made match the negative values which have been suppressed. <![CDATA[

                <p MadCap:conditions="Documents.NotReleaseOverview">When an amended return is submitted it will completely replace the current version of the return held by HMRC. Any previously submitted amendments will also be overwritten. Therefore if any previous amendments to the return were submitted in writing or by phone, they need to be repeated on the amended <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> return before submission. </p>
