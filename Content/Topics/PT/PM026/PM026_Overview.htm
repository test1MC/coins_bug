            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">New </MadCap:conditionalText>Production Tracking functionality is found in the Project Management module. It allows contractors to track the progress of detailed sets of predefined tasks by recording installed quantities against the tasks. Tasks can be grouped together as Work Packages, and progress can be viewed at Work Package level. By assigning a Cost Code to each task, the Cost Code’s percentage complete can be calculated from the task quantities.</p>
        <p class="Body">Production Tracking allows Project Managers to categor<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />e tasks differently than Accounting Cost Codes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet3"><i>Tasks </i>are the detail items that need to be performed/installed at the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> site (such as Pipe, Pipe Hanger, Valve, etc.). Each task has a defined quantity, hours per quantity, and total hours to install.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet3">Tasks are grouped together in a <i>Work Package</i>.  Work Packages can have a quantity but are only for reference.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet3"><i>Actions </i>are the recording of the installed quantity in the field. These can also be scheduled install values, which can then convert into actual installed values.</li>
        </ul>
