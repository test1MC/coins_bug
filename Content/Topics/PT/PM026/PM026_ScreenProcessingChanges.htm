        <p class="Body">The <span class="Function">Select Working Project </span>function on the Project Management menu lets you select a Working Project. The Production Tracking menu (see <MadCap:xref href="#SelWorkProject" class="ImageRef"><i>Figure 2:  Select Working Project</i></MadCap:xref>) is <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">now </MadCap:conditionalText>found within any Working Project that you select from the Select Working Project screen.</p>

        <h3 MadCap:autonum="1.2.2 ">Screen</h3>
        <p class="Body">When you click <span class="Function">Select Working Project </span>from the menu, the screen shown in <MadCap:xref href="#SelWorkProjectScreen" class="ImageRef"><i>Figure 3:  Select Working Project Screen</i></MadCap:xref> appears.</p>
        <p class="Body"> The following changes were made to this function in order to accommodate Production Tracking:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet3">You can add Projects to the My Projects list via the <strong>Add to My Projects </strong>action at the bottom of the screen.
</li>
            <li class="ListBullet3">The last selected Project is used as the default, thus allowing you to bypass the screen and not requiring you to select it each time you access Production Tracking.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet3">Project security is in place and allows you to limit the Projects that users can see.  This security allows group and subgroup values to be assigned to the Project and users.  <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> security is also applied if the Project has turned into a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" />.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="IndentFieldDef"><strong>NOTE:&#160;</strong>To see Projects in the Project list, you must have security access to the primary  <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" />.  In addition, if the Project has linked <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contracts caps" />, the linked <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" />’s security access does not have any impact on what is included in the Project list. The linked <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" />’s security access only comes into play when you attempt to assign a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" />/Cost Code to a Task. If you do not have rights to a linked <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" />, you cannot assign it to a Task. In addition, if you attempt to enter an installed quantity for a Task that has a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> for which you do not have rights, the system does not allow the quantity to be saved.</p>
