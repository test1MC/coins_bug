        <p class="Body">Many <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Marketing caps" />&#160;(MK) functions are used in the Project Management (PT) module. However, this caused a problem for clients who do not have an MK <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" MadCap:conditions="COINS.UKOnly,COINS.USOnly" />. As a temporary fix, MK functions were changed to the System module (SY), which only partially solved the problem.</p>
        <p class="Body">A more permanent solution (as discussed in this document) has resolved this problem by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet3">Re-assigning some MK functions to proper common modules that do not need an MK <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" MadCap:conditions="COINS.UKOnly,COINS.USOnly" />.</li>
            <li class="ListBullet3">Making "switches" that switch between MK functions and functions of other modules, depending on the existence of an MK <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" MadCap:conditions="COINS.UKOnly,COINS.USOnly" />.</li>
        </ul>
