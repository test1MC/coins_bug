            <p>The <span class="function" title="Function:%WBQ1010HBQP">Prices Workbench</span> allows you to maintain a master list of prices that can be applied to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq boq" /> items.</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Adding and Modifying a Price</h2>
        <p class="Body">Regardless of which view you are using within the prices workbench, General, Supplier, All or By Supplier, adding and modifying remains the same, when adding a price to the workbench if there isn’t a supplier associated it will automatically appear in the general tab, likewise, if there is a supplier associated the price will move and be located in the supplier tab.</p>
        <p class="Body">To add an item select <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Add_Both.flsnp" /> from the main action bar at the bottom of the screen. You will be presented with a new screen, this is where you are able to select a resource and start pricing,</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body"> it is worth noting that you can add multiple versions of the same resource as long as the valid from and valid to dates are different.</p>
        <p class="Body">An example of a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Pl Supplier caps" /> price is produced below. Not specifying a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Pl Supplier caps" /> will add this as a General Price.</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="BQ/BOQ Images/Prices Workbench_4b_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="note">As a Supplier has been selected, the general price moves from the general tab to the supplier tab.</p>
        <p class="Body">You should eventually end up with a list of supplier and general prices on your workbench;</p>
        <p class="note">Remember, Supplier listed prices appear on the supplier prices workbench whilst resources that are specified without a supplier appear on the general prices workbench</p>
        <p class="Body">Once you have a list of resources you are then able to modify them using the increase and decrease item using the action menu;</p>
        <p class="Body">&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">When selecting increase items, you can then specify HOW you are wanting to increase the item, this is done either by percentage or by amount. An example of this is below.</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="BQ/BOQ Images/Prices Workbench_8_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">it is worth exploring the different options within this screen as you are able to update and create prices and scheduled increases.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firstly, the increases can be done by percentage or by amount and also rounded up to 4 decimal places.</li>
            <li>The key on this screen is the processing radio button, this enables you to create a new price or update one that you have currently on the system, this allows you to apply the increase whilst keeping the original record or even applying the price for a certain time period.</li>
            <li>You can also set any discounts you may have, agreements in place or any notes that you would like to store against the resource price line.</li>
            <li>Remember: even though you increase the price, you will need to apply the price to either the standard or development level house type.</li>
