        <h1>Setting up users – licences</h1>
        <p>Users can access Employee Self Service as either a normal ‘named’ COINS user or alternatively as a ‘role’ based COINS user</p>
        <h2>‘Named’ licence user</h2>
        <p>Once the licence has been updated to allow access to employee self service, user groups can be set up to allow / deny access to the various functions within Employee Self Service as required and the groups assigned to the relevant users.</p>
        <h2>‘Role’ licence user</h2>
        <p>

            <br />Role licences provide users with finite access to the functionality of the module only and not the remaining areas of the system. When a user is set as a role based user they gain access to all the functions determined by that licence. This can mean it may be necessary to create user groups to limit access to functionality where required. For example, as a standard, users are given access to team calendar and if you want some users to not have access to this then a user group must be created to deny access to that function.</p>

            <br />On the Groups tab tick the ‘Employee Self Service’ role option as shown </p>
        <p>Groups will need to be added to the user to deny access for any functionality as required (Relevant for role licences particularly) </p>
