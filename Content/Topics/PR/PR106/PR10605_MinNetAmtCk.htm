        <p class="Body">The Pay Calculation for a child support payment holds the minimum Weekly PEA (Protected Earnings Amount). Verification ensures that the employee is paid a minimum of this PEA Amount before the deduction can be allowed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The deduction should not result in the wage dropping below the PEA Amount.</li>
            <li>If the resulting deduction is less than what is desired, an appropriate message is printed in the Payroll Calculation to indicate that the full deduction could not occur since the PEA Amount was breached.</li>
        </ul>
