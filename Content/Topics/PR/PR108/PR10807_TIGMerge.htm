        <p class="Body">During Timesheet entry, an employee can have <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" /> or time cards input into multiple Timesheet Input Groups. However, prior to running Payroll Calculations, all <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" /> or time cards that span groups for an employee must be collected into a <i>single </i>Timesheet Input Group. The <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText><span class="Function">Group Merge </span>function (<MadCap:xref href="#TSGroupMerge" class="ImageRef"><i> Timesheet Input Group Merge Screen</i></MadCap:xref>) allows you to merge <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" /> or timesheets for selected Timesheet Input Groups into a single Timesheet Input Group. It is available on the Timesheet Input Groups menu for each PR Frequency.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can merge one of your own groups or subordinate groups that are not frozen.</li>
            <li>Selected groups should be in the selected period or have a blank period.</li>
            <li>The selected Timesheet Input Groups are deleted after the merge if they no longer contain <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" /> or time cards.</li>
            <li>Only employees with non-calculated, accepted, or paid payroll are processed during the merge.</li>
