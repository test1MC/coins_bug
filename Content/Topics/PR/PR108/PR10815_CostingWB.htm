        <p class="Body"><span class="Function">Validate Batches </span>on the Costing Workbench <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">now </MadCap:conditionalText>marks all groups in current unposted Regular/Adjusting periods as validated if a validation has been passed successfully. This can only be done if the TS Groups are in use for the company. If Group Validation is performed successfully on the individual Timesheet Input Groups, it is not necessary to run the Validate Batches process again on the Costing Workbench.</p>
        <p class="Body">The <span class="Function">Post Batches </span>function will post process all Timesheet Input Groups used in a Regular or Adjusting period.   You will not be able to post payroll if all Timesheet Input Groups have not been completely processed and all <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheques" /> updated with a status of Paid and the Group Validation or Validate Batches has not been run.</p>
        <p class="Body">All Timesheet Input Groups associated with the Regular or Adjusting Period are deleted once payroll has been posted. This is possible since the groups are associated with the period and year. If you plan to reuse the&#160;TS&#160;Input Groups, they must be re-created for the next payroll period.</p>
