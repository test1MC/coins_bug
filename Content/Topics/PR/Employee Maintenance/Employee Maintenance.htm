        <p>In Payroll, each employee record is identified by a unique Employee Number. The employee record holds information about the employee, such as: personal, tax and NI details; pay history; court orders. The employee record also holds details of the pay elements (pay items) that make up the employee's payslip.</p>
        <p>In order to find the relevant information quicker, each group of information of each employee record is aggregated under different tabs:</p>

            <li><b>Sequence Items Tab</b>: Sequences contain pay items that define the payments, totals, deductions and costing totals for that sequence. You can have as many sequences as required to define what pay items are used. Each employee can only have one sequence. The sequence will be in the order that the pay is calculated by <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</li>
            <li><b>Pay History Tab</b>: displays the pay history of the employee.</li>
            <li><b>NI Details Tab</b>: allows you to view and maintain the period by period NI amounts.</li>
        </ul>
