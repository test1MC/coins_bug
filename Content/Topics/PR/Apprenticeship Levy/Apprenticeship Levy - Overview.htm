        <p>From 2017 some employers will be required to pay a new apprenticeship levy. This will be charged at a rate of 0.5% of an employer’s pay bill where the annual pay bill is greater than £3,000,000.</p>
        <p>The pay bill is the same as the total NI-able pay except that it does not include any earnings of employees who are under 16 or who are not subject to UK NICs legislation (so anyone using NI code X) nor any payments to employees working abroad that are making employee only contributions. This can be handled in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> by using a logical caption ZEROERNI see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../../../../temp/2017 Docs/Content/Topics/Modules/Payroll/Apprenticeship Levy/Apprenticeship Levy - Zero Employer NI.htm">0.1, <i>Apprenticeship Levy - Zero Employer NI</i></MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>The £3,000,000 minimum pay bill rule is handled via an annual levy allowance of £15,000 per employer which offsets the levy liability. The levy liability is calculated on a cumulative monthly basis and the annual allowance is prorated for the year before being offset against this.</p>
