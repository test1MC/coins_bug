        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="COINS.ScreenOnly"> COINS OA v11.07 US Payroll allows for emailing W-2 Forms and printing full W-2 Forms on blank paper. Functionality for this includes the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To eliminate alignment errors that occurred because the boxes on the W-2 Form are small, you can <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">now </MadCap:conditionalText>produce a 4-part W-2 for distribution to employees. It is printed on special blank paper with three perforations between each part, and W-2 related text is pre-printed on the back side of the form.</li>
            <li>You can <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">now </MadCap:conditionalText>email a W-2 Form as a password-protected PDF document. This <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>W-2 email process works in the same way as emailing Payroll Payslips and 1095-C documents.</li>
            <li>Payroll departments <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">now </MadCap:conditionalText>have the choice to save a W-2 against an employee record, which makes the document available in the Employee Self Service Portal.</li>
        </ul>
