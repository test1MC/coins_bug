        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 ">Overview</h1>
        <p class="Body">Some COINS OA users experienced <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> numbers being stored incorrectly against the PR <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cheque caps" /> record when two Print <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cheque caps" /> processes for the same bank were run simultaneously. A stop was added to prevent both the simultaneous Print <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cheque caps" /> processes and the return of the user to <span class="Function">Print <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cheques caps"></MadCap:variable></span>.</p>
        <p class="Body">However, users received an error that Print <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cheques caps" /> was already in process for the bank and were subsequently returned to the Main tab of <span class="Function">Print <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cheques caps" /></span> (thus re-defaulting the bank number). Once returned to the Main tab, if a user did not refresh the page before waiting to click the <span class="Button">Next Action </span>button after the <span class="Function">Print <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cheques caps" /></span> function was completed, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> number presented was not necessarily the next available number. This caused issues when the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> number assigned to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> record was a duplicate and did not match the printed <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> number or the values included in the Positive Pay files sent to the bank.</p>
