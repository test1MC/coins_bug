        <p class="Body">Many COINS clients participate as contractors in government-funded work.  As a contractor on these projects, you may be required to submit Certified Payroll Reports to support the payment of wages and benefits earned by employees performing work on these projects. Federal government agencies use the Certified WH-347 Form. However, non-Federal government agencies may have their own version of the Federal Form WH-347 and its accompanying Statement of Compliance, and they may use LCP Tracker software for it.</p>
