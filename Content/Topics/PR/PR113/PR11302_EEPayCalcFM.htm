        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 ">Employee Pay Calculation File Maintenance</h1>
        <p class="Body">If the Pay Calculation included in <span class="Function">Pay Calculation File Maintenance</span> is in Employee Maintenance Pay Calculations, and it is a Flat Amount value, that Pay Calculation will be included as an Override when <span class="Field">Final Payment </span>is <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed and the number of pay periods is entered when creating a computer <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" />.</p>
        <p class="Body">For example, if NT-MED is <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed in Pay Calculation Maintenance to include in a Final Payment, and it is in the Employee File with a Flat Amount value of $27.50, when the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cheque caps" /> is created (<MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /><span class="Field"> Final Payment </span>and enter 3 weeks), the Override for Pay Calculation NT-MED will be computed as $27.50 x 3 = $82.50 and stored as an <i>Override </i>on the check with Transaction 0.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you modify the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cheque caps" />’s <span class="Field">Final Payment </span><MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box or the <span class="Field">Payment Weeks Remaining</span>, the computed amount stored as an Override is updated.</li>
            <li>You may modify the Override created by the Final Payment Process; however, updating the <span class="Field">Payment Weeks Remaining </span>or the <span class="Field">Final Payment </span><MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box will overwrite your changes.</li>
            <li>You may use the Final Payment process on Computer or Future <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cheques caps" /> and in the Manual <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cheque caps" /> Calculator.</li>
