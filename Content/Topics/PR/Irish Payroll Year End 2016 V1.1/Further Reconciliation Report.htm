        <p class="Body">If required, print additional reports to investigate and correct any anomalies. Below are a few suggested reports:</p>
        <p class="pseudoH4">Employee Pay Item Details</p>
        <p class="Body">Run this report to work out period on period tax and total amounts for year.</p>
        <p class="Caption" MadCap:autonum="Figure 1: ">COINSplus <i>[Period]</i> Payroll Reports Menu</p>
        <p class="Body">

        </p>
        <p class="pseudoH4">Employee PRSI Details</p>
        <p class="Body">Reconcile contribution figures using this report also. You will need to select the relevant employee and employer’s PRSI pay item codes, which are defined on the second screen of the Payroll Configuration function.</p>
        <p class="pseudoH4">Employee Selected Items</p>
        <p class="Body">This reports on employee pay items (to a maximum of ten). You can display department or location totals for each item and the overall total.</p>
        <p class="Caption" MadCap:autonum="Figure 2: ">COINSplus <i>[Period]</i> Payroll Reports Menu</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PR/Irish Payroll Year End 2016 V1.1/Further Reconciliation Report_1.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">Employee Selected Item Report Can be configured to show period amount and year to date amount.</p>
        <p class="Caption" MadCap:autonum="Figure 3: ">Figure 15: OA <i>[Period]</i> Payroll Selected Item Report</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PR/Irish Payroll Year End 2016 V1.1/Further Reconciliation Report_2.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="pseudoH4">Costing Check for Year End Reconciliation</p>
        <p class="Body">This report will show the difference for both year to date and period on period tax values. To run this report you need to have sufficient access to use the command line within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. If you are unable to run this please contact your systems administrator.</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PR/Irish Payroll Year End 2016 V1.1/Further Reconciliation Report.jpg" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">To access the command line press the dot key on your keyboard.</p>
        <p class="Body">Enter the following for the payroll you are working on:</p>
        <p class="Body">For weekly payroll:</p>
        <p class="Body">pr365.p (“0”)</p>
        <p class="Body">Change the “0” to a “1” for monthly, to “2” for fortnightly and to “3” for four weekly.</p>
        <p class="Body">It should be run for each pay frequency within each <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> company as necessary.</p>
        <p class="Body">Selection criteria are Tax Year, Check Costs Posted (Y or N) and employee selection.</p>
        <p class="Body">The report only shows exceptions. Where it finds an exception it will display the employee number and name, as well as a detailed description of the problem.</p>
        <p class="Body">At the end of the report it shows the total number of employees checked.</p>
        <p class="pseudoH4">Tax and Taxable Pay check</p>
        <p class="Body">The pay item YTD value matches the previous employment figures plus what has been paid period by period. If the figures do not match you will get detail on which period(s) has discrepancies. There are two possible tax exception messages:</p>
        <p class="Body">If the item YTD value is out by the exact figure of the previous employment value then:</p>
        <p class="code">"Item X YTD is missing the P45 Previous employment figure"</p>
        <p class="Body">Otherwise:</p>
        <p class="code">"Item X YTD does not equal the sum of period values in period Y".</p>
        <p class="pseudoH4">PRSI Check</p>
        <p class="Body">The total of the gross employee and employer contributions is compared to the combined net contributions held on the employee pay items. Again, if the figures do not match you will get detail on which period(s) has discrepancies. The exception description is:</p>
        <p class="code">"Employer/Employee PRSI Details record does not match Item X in period Y"</p>
