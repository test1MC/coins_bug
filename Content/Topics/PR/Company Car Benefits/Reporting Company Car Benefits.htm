        </h1>
        <p>From 2017 details of payrolled company car benefits can optionally be included on FPS submissions. This will become mandatory from April 2018. Company car information is not reportable on an EYU so these changes will apply to FPS submissions only.</p>
        <p>The car data is entered in <span class="module">Fixed Assets</span>. This can then be allocated to a HR person, which can be done from within <span class="module">Payroll</span> <span class="function">Employee Maintenance</span> as well as in HR. </p>
        <p>It is not essential to payroll company car benefits; they can just be operated as old-style benefits in kind and reported on the employee’s P11D.</p>
        <h1 MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly" style="page-break-before: avoid;" MadCap:autonum="2 ">Initial Configuration</h1>
        <p>Because <span class="module">Fixed Assets</span> is being used, you will need to have this module if you want to payroll any company car benefits. It is not however necessary to have the HR module as the HR records can be created simply by setting up Payroll-HR linking with the CO parameter <span class="parameter">PRMAKEHR</span> set to ‘Y’ (see <MadCap:xref href="../../WD/WDHR5111_Payroll-HR_Linking_Of_Salary_and_Benefits.html" class="doclink"><i>Payroll-HR Linking</i> in the online documentation</MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <p>Pay items need to be set up to include the benefit in the payroll calculation, and the PR&#160;parameter <span class="parameter">BIKITEMS</span> needs to include these pay items.</p>

</h2>
        <p>The validation and XML generation has been updated to cover payrolled company cars.
The data is submitted automatically in the first FPS in the year from which the benefit applies. </p>
        <p>If there is a change to any of this car information during the year, the full set of car fields is resubmitted. If a payrolled company car is removed (by deleting the record or changing it so that it is no longer a payrolled car), the change will set the amounts to zero and the last available day for the car to be the same as the first available day. This is only an appropriate course of action when a mistake has been made and should not be done when a company car benefit is simply withdrawn from an employee at a later date.
