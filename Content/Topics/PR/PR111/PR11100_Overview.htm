        <p class="Body">W-2s are tax forms prepared by an employer and given to an employee to be filed with the 1040 Form. Locality taxing is reported on the W-2 Form for employees who work in areas where Localities are prevalent. Some areas have numerous Localities, which can result in employees working in many Localities over the course of a year and therefore receiving a W-2 from each of those Localities.</p>
        <p class="Body">Although COINS OA provides users with the ability to generate W-2 Forms, additional functionality <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">now </MadCap:conditionalText>allows employees to print a single W-2 Form for all of the Localities where they worked per State. It shows a total value for all of the Locality tax paid for that State.</p>
        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">This document describes changes made in COINS OA to provide you with the ability to print W-2s with multiple Localities. These changes apply to the US Region only.</p>
        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="COINS.ScreenOnly">COINS OA Payroll provides you with the ability to print W-2s with multiple Localities. This applies to the US Region only.</p>
