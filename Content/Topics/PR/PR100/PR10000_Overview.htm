        <p class="Body">The Union Detail Report in Payroll can split out wage rates when a change occurs within a Payroll period. Union <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contracts caps" /> will renew on the first of a month, which could fall within any day during the payroll period.  Union rates for employees usually change when <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract caps" /> renewals take effect during the Payroll period, and COINS OA users wanted the Union Detail Report to break out rates based on the dates of the wages before and after the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract caps" /> went into effect.</p>
        <p class="Body">To satisfy this request, the PR Union Detail Report can now split Union Calculations by Weeks for all records into two sections as a result of the addition of a new <span class="Field">Summary Date </span>field:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="ListBullet3"><strong>First section </strong>- goes up to the Summary Date, and</li>
            <li class="ListBullet3"><strong>Second section </strong>- summar<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />es the information on and after the Summary Date.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">This enhancement is applicable for the US, Canadian, and Australian markets.</p>
