        <p>For Ireland as part of the steps towards implementing PAYE Modernisation in Jan 2019 the Revenue want to ensure the employee data on employers’ and on their own systems are in agreement. To help them do this they will be requiring employers to submit a new List of Employees report in 2018. To support this, new employee fields have been added, and a new report provided to produce the required data file.</p>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>There is a small amount of data entry for customers to do before producing the file:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go through current employees who are directors and tick the new <span class="field">Proprietary Director</span> tickbox where applicable.</li>
            <li>Go through current employees with an exclusion order and enter the exclusion order start and end dates where known.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>ROS List of Employees
</h2>
        <p>The new ROS List of Employee report has been added to the Global Reports menu.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images_P-R/PR/ROS_List_of_Employees.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>The report selection consists of the employer registration number and the date to run the report for. The report includes all employees who were in employment on the date selected.

 
When run this creates an XML file under My Files for submission to ROS, as well as a PDF report of the employee data for users to look at.
</p>
        <p>If this report when run produces a status of <b>Complete(with errors)</b>,  the XML file will not be created or available in My Files. Refer to the Messages section in the report, which lists details of any errors. These will need to be corrected first  before recreating  the report which will in turn also produce the XML file in My Files.
