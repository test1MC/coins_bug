        <p class="Body">COINS OA users could not review the Taxable flags set up on all of their Pay Calculations, and there was no way to export that data (as can be done with Federal Taxation information of Payroll Calculations). A <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>Pay Calculation Taxability Report in Payroll makes it easier for you to review the Taxable flags of Federal, State, and Locality jurisdictions set up on all Pay Calculations.</p>
