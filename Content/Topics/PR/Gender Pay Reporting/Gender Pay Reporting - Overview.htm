        <p>From 2017, any organisation in the UK that has 250 or more employees must publish and report specific figures about their gender pay gap.</p>
        <p>Reporting is based on a snapshot date which for businesses is 5 April each year.  Organisations must publish within a year of the snapshot date. So businesses must publish by 4 April each year.  The first reports must be published by 4 April 2018 based on a snapshot date of 5 April 2017.

</p>
        <p>Three <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> reports have been created to help employers with their gender pay gap reporting obligations.</p>
