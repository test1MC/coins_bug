        <p>A new field has been added to the <span class="function">Employee Maintenance</span> screen.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PR/Gender Pay Reporting/Weekly Working Hours Field.png" class="FullWidth" />

        <p class="Subtitle">Field</p>
        <div class="FieldTable">
            <div class="ListHead">
                <div class="ColHead">Field</div>
                <div class="ColHead">Description</div>
            </div>
            <div class="FieldBlock">
                <div class="FieldLabel">
                    <p>Weekly Working Hours<![CDATA[	]]></p>
                </div>
                <div class="FieldDef">
                    <p>This is required to calculate the hourly pay for salaried employees. </p>
                    <p>For hourly-paid employees a calculation based on a 12-week average must be used, so whilst the field is available for these employees, it is not used in calculating the gender pay gap statistics.
 
</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>This field is validated against the <span class="field">RTI Normal Hours Worked Per Week</span> hours band field to make sure the two are consistent. The <span class="field">Weekly Working Hours</span> field links via Payroll-HR linking to the existing <span class="field">Hours</span> field in HR for the same thing. The new Payroll field will initial<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />e itself to be the same as the HR field value (where there is a linked HR record) and failing this set a best guess based on the RTI hours band.
</p>
        <p>Over time an employee’s weekly working hours may change so the current value will be stored against each period on the payslip record, as will the hourly/salary paid field. In this way the gender pay gap reports will be able to produce <MadCap:variable name="Variables.as at" /> results. </p>
        <p>As these changes will not be delivered in time for the first snapshot date of the 5th April 2017 any changes to this field are effectively back-dated to the period including the 5th April 2017.
</p>
        <p>This new field will appear for all regions, not just for the UK, though it will only appear for non-UK regions from the next release and not existing versions of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.
