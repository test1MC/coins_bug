        <p>Three <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>reports cover the calculations of all the required statistics. These reports appear for UK payrolls only under the Global Reports menu. Each report shows the stages in the calculation as well as the final statistics.
</p>
        <p>Employers must calculate and report:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The mean gender pay gap.</li>
            <li>The median gender pay gap.</li>
            <li>The mean bonus gender pay gap.</li>
            <li>The median bonus gender pay gap.</li>
            <li>The proportion of males and females receiving a bonus payment.</li>
            <li>The proportion of males and females in each quartile band.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is important to note that there are some situations where <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> may not be able to get the results exactly correct. For example the non-bonus pay gap calculations require you to include everyone who is employed on the snapshot date and who is being paid their usual full pay during the pay period which includes this snapshot date. Any employee who is paid less than normal due to being on leave must be omitted, though any employee who is paid less than normal for any other reason must still be included. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will make the best guess it can on this, but it may be imperfect. You can however take the Excel version of the report produced, manually modify the employees included as appropriate and use Excel to recalculate totals and averages and recalculate the required statistics.
