            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Employee Leaver Status</h1>
        <p class="Body">The <span class="Function">Employee Leaver Status</span> option has been removed as it caused problems when choosing to create a new employee record based on a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.leaver employee" /> (due to being unable to set mandatory fields). It was also unnecessary as amending of employee leaver statuses can easily be done in <span class="Function">Employee Maintenance</span>. Copying a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.leaver employee" /> in <span class="Function">Employee Maintenance</span> is the quickest way to create a new employee for someone who has left, which crucially gives you access to the new starter fields which cannot simply be copied.</p>
