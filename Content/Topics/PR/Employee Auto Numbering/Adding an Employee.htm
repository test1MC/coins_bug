        <p class="Body">The <span class="Field">Employee</span> number field will always be updateable when adding a new record. To allow the employee number to be left blank initially, this is no longer marked as a mandatory field, though the validation requires a value for this before actually creating the new employee record.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If <span class="parameter">EMPAUTON</span> is blank then the user is required to set the employee number.</li>
            <li>If <span class="parameter">EMPAUTON</span> is ‘IFBLANK’ then if the user enters an employee number this is used and if they do not <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> auto-generates the number.</li>
            <li>If <span class="parameter">EMPAUTON</span> is ‘ALWAYS’ then the user is only allowed to enter a number which matches a HR ID for a person who is waiting to be added to this payroll. If they attempt to enter anything else they will get an error. If they leave the employee number field blank <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> auto-generates the new number.</li>
