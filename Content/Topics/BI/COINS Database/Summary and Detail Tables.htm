        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> has designed its database to match the processes of the industry and therefore the tables mirror the process components. Each of the modules will cover different process and within each module we can find different sub-processes. The organizational structure of the company is also related to the structure of the tables.</p>
        <p>Each of these sub-processes are also divided in tables that will hold information down to the lowest level of detail and there will also be tables that will summarize that information at different levels (depending to the process these could be dates, codes etc).</p>
