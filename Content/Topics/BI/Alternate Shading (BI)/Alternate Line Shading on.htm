            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Alternate Line Shading on Forms and Reports</h1>
        <p>This guide provides instructions for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Business Intelligence and Reporting designers on how to shade alternate lines of PDF reports and forms.</p>
        <p>It is expected that the user performing the tasks outline in this How-To guide has completed <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Business Intelligence and Reporting training.</p>
        <p>Alternate line shading allows the report reader to associate right most totalling or display columns with the detail on the left of the page as shown below:<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/Alternate Shading (BI)/Alternate Line Shading on.png" class="FullWidth" /></p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #bed230;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Always perform all implementation and testing of report and/or form alterations in an up to date, non-live environment before attempting to migrate your changes into the LIVE environment.</p>
        <p>When migrating your changes to the LIVE environment it is recommended that you have a working, complete backup of the LIVE environment.</p>
