The description will appear as the description in the Activity Workbench for the stage (with the Workflow TaskID reference). The label is used to determine the links between stages. The Id which is shown on screen will be automatically assigned and is useful when debugging the workflow with the tools on the Check tab (see documentation further on in this document).</p>
        <p class="Body">The workflow role will determine who will be assigned a stage or task in the workflow. A role can be one of three options:</p>

        <p class="Body">An individual can also be calculated from the Workflow document or ‘hard-coded’ into the role calculation.</p>
        <p class="Body">If any stage is assigned to more than one user, the task will appear on each user's workbench. As soon as one user assigns their task to a status of anything other than ‘Not Started’ the corresponding tasks on all other users Workbenches will be completed. It will remain available for view and will be automatically updated with the progress and user of who has started the task.&#160; If they put the status back to “Not Started” then the task will be replaced on all the users in the group again.</p>
        <p class="Body">Once any of the tasks are completed all tasks on other user’s workbenches are then completed.</p>
        <p class="Body">An individual being assigned a task from any of the options above must be a valid <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> User and must be licensed for Workflow.</p>
        <p class="Body">If an Email stage is being used, a valid email address needs to be assigned either against the User ID, or if appropriate, the associated <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> HR Personnel record. If an SMS stage is to be used it is necessary to have an associated HR record so that <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can access the appropriate mobile telephone number.</p>
