        <p class="Body">On occasions it is desirable to be able to find and amend all the role assignments for a user.&#160; This can be done by searching through the responsibilities maintenance screen but it is possible for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to do this for you.&#160; This might be useful if a user leaves the business and a new user is to be assigned to each of their role responsibilities.</p>

        <p class="Body">The User Workflow Responsibility maintenance screen shows a list of users.&#160; Select the link on the user for which you want to maintain responsibilities. All responsibility records which contain the selected user are shown for update.</p>

        <p class="Body">These records can now be amended.&#160; When amending the user name, please note that the new user must be licensed for workflow.</p>
        <p class="Body">The regenerate button can be pressed to regenerate the list. The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Next_Both.flsnp" /> button can be used to go back to the user selection screen.</p>
