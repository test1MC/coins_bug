            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Workflow Overview</h1>
        <p class="Body">People are most productive when they are doing the things they are good at – thinking, communicating, creating. They are least productive and most prone to error when they are involved in boring, repetitive processes. Just the opposite is true of systems.</p>
        <p>Businesses are therefore most efficient when they have the three key resources of people, processes, and systems properly balanced, integrated, and focused on their strengths:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <p class="Body" style="list-style-type: disc;">People developing and implementing processes and new ways of working.</p>
            <p class="Body" style="list-style-type: disc;">Processes that optimise quality, consistency, timeliness, and governance/audit.</p>
            <p class="Body" style="list-style-type: disc;">Systems that facilitate the way people work by automating the core processes.</p>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body"><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Workflow brings the benefits of this integration to construction businesses.
