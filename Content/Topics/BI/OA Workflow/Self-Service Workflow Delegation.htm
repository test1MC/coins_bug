            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Self-Service Workflow Delegation</h1>
        <p class="Body">When a user who takes part in a workflow is going to be absent from work they will wish to delegate the roles they fulfil to one or more other users.</p>
        <p class="Body">This can be done in the delegation maintenance procedure described above&#160; however the delegation maintenance routine gives access to all users’ delegations so is not appropriate for many users.</p>
        <p class="Body">A function is provided that allows the user to set up and maintain delegations for themselves only.&#160; A new tab is shown on the user preferences <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.Pre-v1105">(accessed by the <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/OA Workflow/Workflow Delegation_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 19px;height: 20px;" /> button in the toolbar)</MadCap:conditionalText> for the user when they are logged in; if they are licensed for workflow.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">This screen shows the same information as the full delegation maintenance screen except that the user is fixed and shown in the header.&#160; The same rules apply for setting of the delegations as in the full version.</p>
        <p class="Body">There is a button provided in the footer <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/OA Workflow/Workflow Delegation_3.png" style="width: 185px; height: 31px;" class="HalfWidth" MadCap:conditions="COINS.Pre-v1105" /> <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/OA Workflow/Workflow Delegation_3_1106.png" class="HalfWidth" />that will scan all workflow assignments in all companies and build one delegation record per role.&#160; This is an aid to the user to ensure they do not miss a role.&#160; The records are created with a blank delegation (i.e. no delegation) but the record being present is a reminder to set it if required.&#160; They can be deleted or left blank if no delegation is required.</p>
