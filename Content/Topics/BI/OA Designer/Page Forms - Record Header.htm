            <MadCap:concept term="OA Designer;Topics" />Page Forms - Record Header</h1>
        <p>A Record Header appears above tabs in Update or Detail.  It allows you to put record context (as opposed to parent context) above the record you are updating.  It can also include fields that are updateable.  The record header appears above any tab folders that are specified and is therefore visible on each tab. This would be useful say on a maintenance screen where the code and description are put in the record header and the other fields in the tab section.</p>
