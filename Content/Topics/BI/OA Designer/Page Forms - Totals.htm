            <MadCap:concept term="OA Designer;Topics" />Page Forms - Totals</h1>
        <p>Provides a totals form for a browse.  If you total a non-integer/decimal field you will get a field count, otherwise you will get the sum of the value displayed.</p>
        <p>Totals can also be placed at the bottom of the columns.  On each field of a page section there is a field Total: .  If ticked and you create a Total form, the total for the column will be placed in a total line at the end of the body section when the total button is pressed.  Any fields added to the total form are then presented under this body total line.   A record count is placed in the first column (selection/filter section).</p>
