        <p>The Form sections should be added as required, as a minimum a Body section should be created.</p>
        <p>Fields are then assigned to the Body as required. The fields can be extracted from the Database Enquiry depending on the query using the same principles as when setting up Pages for browsing and enquiries.</p>
