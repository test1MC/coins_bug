            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Default Report Labels</h1>
        <p>Default report labels are used to populate the automagic behaviour behind the Header X Forms and Footer X Columns.   They provide the Label Name and the Field List which appear in the standard Headers and Footers which appear on Reports by Sort Levels.   It is important to remember that changes to this table will affect ALL reports and not just a single report. </p>
        <p>If you would like to override this automagic behaviour on any report you can always add the fields as required to the relevant form on the bespoke report. (i.e. as soon as you add fields to a Header Form or Footer Columns you override the automagic behaviour).  This is not always desireable as this means that you would have to keep your accumulated totals manually to display in the footer columns  -  It is probably more desireable to maintain the use of the Footer Columns and to also make use of the addtional forms available at all levels do any additional calculations or display further information. </p>
        <p>For example for every Footer X Column there is an equivalent Footer X Form which will appear directly beneath this form.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #bed230;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Footer Forms will automatically display information details one underneath the other so it is often necessary to append records to appear across the page.</p>
