        <p>To generate a  Page or Report in coins OA there are three development components :</p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/OA Designer/Design Components.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>A function in OA simply runs a procedure  (unless defined as a menu). </p>
        <p>This procedure is nearly always wou005.p and it simply builds a webpage for display in coins OA.</p>
        <p>To determine what is displayed and how it is displayed, coins OA (wou005.p) uses Pages. </p>
        <p>A Page Design contains Form definitions for the webpage. These Forms definitions may include headers, bodies, footers, totals etc. Each of these Form Types will also have Fields defined for display.</p>
        <p>In addition, Pages also allow for the definition of Filters which will be available on the webpage when the function is run.</p>
        <p>When you are running a Report in coins OA, the Function will still reference a Page, however this webpage will contain only the information (layout and fields required) for the report selection criteria.The actually definition of fields, layout, headers and totals are then maintained in the Report Design.</p>
        <p>When you create a new function in coins OA – until you have completed the Page Design nothing will be returned to screen. If this function is to be a report, it is also necessary to define the Report Design.</p>
