            <MadCap:concept term="OA Designer;Topics" />Page Forms - Add</h1>
        <p>This is similar to a preadd form in that it is required before an add.  The difference is that the Add Type form appears in the button bar before the Add Button.  There is no structure to the form, the fields are simply placed side by side before the add button.</p>
        <p>The example where this will be first used is the adding of a PO line.  There are a small number of different types of line that can be added.  The contents of the body change depending on the type of line being added.  By having the add type field available in the URL that is passed to the add page, the page can be changed dynamically by looking at the value of the add type field.</p>
        <p>Add type fields are prefixed addtype.</p>
        <p>So, if pol_type was specified in the addtype form then the URL would contain addtypepol_type=XXX and this could be used to create the appropriate type of order line.</p>
        <p>You must use view-as combo for add type fields.</p>
