        <h1>
            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Headers and Footers</h1>
        <p>Multiple Headers and Footers are associated with the Sort options assigned to the Report Section. If Sort options have been set, simply click the Total box in Report Field Maintenance and <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA will define the appropriate subtotals and totals in relation to the sort options defined.</p>
        <p>As long as header and footer forms have been defined for the report, to correspond to the sort levels, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will populate these automatically with the fields the report is sorting by. However, it is necessary to specify labels and descriptions for these fields.</p>
        <p>To provide column totals, add a "Total Columns" form (for report run totals) or a "Footer Columns" form (for subtotals); again, no fields are required on the form; on the field records for the fields to be totalled, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the Total box.</p>
        <p>The contents of the header and footer forms can be overridden by adding fields manually.</p>
