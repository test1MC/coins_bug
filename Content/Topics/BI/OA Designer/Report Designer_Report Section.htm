        <p>As with Page Sections, the Report Section should be given the same code as the calling Function.</p>
        <p>Add the Header and Body tables which will be reported against. The Header and Body Tables assigned to a page will dictate which RSPs are accessed by the query, and as such will provide certain business logic to the Page. It is recommended that co_config (<MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Company configuration) and the configuration table of the Module being queried, for example jc_config are used as Header Tables.</p>
        <p>In the Query section add in a simple Query - if appropriate including any SelectionGenerate fields. </p>
        <p>Against Page Layout select the page/paper size required from the drop down selection, and also the Class.</p>
        <p>The class in its simplest form will denote the font used within the report, but will also provide other formatting functions such as background <MadCap:variable name="Variables.colour" />. </p>
        <p>The sort option provides simple sort options, but also is the key for using headers, footers and subtotals within a report.</p>
        <p>For a simple report, just add in a standard sort option on one of the main fields. To use the Excel Export format of the report, also enter an Export Name for the sort fields.</p>
        <p>Save the Report and then select Report Form Maintenance </p>
