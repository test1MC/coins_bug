        <p>Tables are scrollable tables of information that can be used anywhere, but here we concentrate on adding them to a Tile.</p>
        <p>In order to put a table on a tile, you need to build a browse with fields on it.&#160; This can be directly against a database table, if you already have data or you can build a dataset to create the data required before the chart is produced.</p>
        <p>Tables offer the benefit of a pre-built search field, allowing any information in the tile to be located, and (since the data is sent client side) the ability to include RO_Fields on the table which will be sortable – something that previously required a dataset.</p>
