            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Alternative Desktops</h1>
        <p>You can setup more than one desktop (which you can think of as roles of the user or personas of the user) the user then can select from the available desktops switching their role/persona.&#160; The tabs, sections and items on the desktop refresh based on the latest selected role/persona.</p>
        <h2>User Maintenance</h2>
        <p>A new option is introduced on the user maintenance page</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>The alternative desktops is a list of desktops that will already exist that the user can switch to.&#160; The currently selected desktop is shown in the existing desktop field.&#160; This is the one that the user will see if they login (or refresh) the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> page.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The alternative desktops are shown at the top left of the desktop above the tabs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>As soon as you select an alternative (examples are similar but different tabs, sections and tiles) your user record is changed so that this becomes you default desktop and the page is refreshed showing you the new desktop.</p>
