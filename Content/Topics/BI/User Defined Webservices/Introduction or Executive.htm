        <p>What are web services? The easiest way to answer this question is to think of web services as a way of extracting and putting information from and to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p>It allows <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to interact with other systems, this is not necessarily other ERP systems but companies such as HMRC.</p>
        <p>For a long time, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> have used web services, although it hasn’t been as obvious in the UI as it is in the background, CIS, eRCT, RTI all use forms of SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) requests to contact and exchange information with a third party.</p>
        <p>Web services works by exchanging the data in an xml format, this format ensures that each part of the data that you are sending/exchanging is encompassed by ‘tags’ that define where/what the system should be doing with it.</p>
        <p>Each tag starts with and ends with the triangle brackets (&lt; and &gt;) to classify and denote an ending of a tag the forward slash is used; each tag will end up looking something similar to this:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&lt;this is a tag&gt; DATA &lt;/this is a tag&gt;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This section describes the capability for the user to define services using existing components of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p>The user is able to define the following general capabilities using OA designer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Datasets – to extract data records for use on reports</li>
            <li>Page Maintenance – which can include add, update and delete capabilities</li>
            <li>Calculation Programs – that can run low level methods in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> RSPs to extract and/or manipulate data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is now possible for the user to also define an interface that matches up to these generic features so that they can be run as a service to be exposed on an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) or as a Webservice.</p>
