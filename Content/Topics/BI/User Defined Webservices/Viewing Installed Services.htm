            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Viewing Installed Services</h1>
        <p>To view the services installed on your system, take your standard environment access URL, such as:</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">http://195.40.14.50/cgi-bin/oartvol11/wologin.p</span>
        </p>
        <p>and replace wologin.p (and anything after it) with wouesp.p</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">http://195.40.14.50/cgi-bin/oartvol11/wouesb.p</span>
        </p>
        <p>The following page should be displayed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/User Defined Webservices/Viewing Installed Services.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>The contents of this page will vary, depending on the services installed on your particular system. </p>
        <p>Please note that this page will be displayed regardless of the licensing installed on your system – this means that although you will be able to view the services, you may not be able to run certain ones if you have not been licensed to do so.</p>
        <p>Selecting a Module Service, for example JC – Contract Status, will display the services for that module:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/User Defined Webservices/Viewing Installed Services_1.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>If you then drill down into a particular service, For example JCESB008 – Company Changes, you will be taken into a page detailing the schema, field definitions and sample messages for the service.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/User Defined Webservices/Viewing Installed Services_2.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>If this page does not show the fields and sample messages, Web Services has not been configured and you will need to contact <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Support to arrange for Tech Services to investigate</p>
