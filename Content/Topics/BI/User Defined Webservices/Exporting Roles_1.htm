        <p>To Export a role from development, log in to the development environment. Under the system module &gt; User Maintenance you will find an import and export role function, along with the roles function its self.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Identify the role that you are wanting to import into another environment, remember all roles are in the ‘Roles’ function.</p>
        <p>Once you know which role you need navigate to the ‘Export Roles’ function.</p>
        <p>Type in the Role that you are wanting to export and press <span class="Button">NEXT</span></p>

        </p>
        <p>The role detail is then built up for you to copy and paste into the new environment.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Now that you have the role you can navigate to the new environment and log in as sysadmin.</p>
        <p>Remember, if you are not logged in as sysadmin you will not be able to import/export roles from an environment</p>
