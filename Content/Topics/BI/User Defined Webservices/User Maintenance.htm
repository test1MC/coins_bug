            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />User Maintenance</h1>
        <p>In order for any of the web services to work (regardless of it being accessible and viewable) the role and the user has to be set up correctly. This depends on a few things, the role needs to be in the system, if it isn’t you’d need to log into dev, export the role and import it into the customer environment. You MUST be logged in as sysadmin on the customer environment to be able to see the ‘export/import role’ function.</p>
        <p>The user must also be set up to be able to use web services and must have the correct role assigned, please bear in mind that any new role used has a cost implication and should be discussed with the account manager/project manager.</p>
        <p>The User profile needs only three things in order for it to work correctly, against the main ‘details’ page under the ‘named user’ section, there is a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> box ‘web services’ that needs to be ticked, a web services company needs to also be specified.</p>

        </p>
        <p>On the second tab ‘GROUPS’ the web service role needs to be selected, the only exception to the individual web service roles are when implementing and testing, this can be achieved by using the %ESB role which essentially gives access to ALL web services, very few customers will have this in place, only thelarger customers  will have this.</p>
