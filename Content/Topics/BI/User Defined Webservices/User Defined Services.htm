        <p>Where a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Webservice does not exist that meets your requirements, User Defined Services, as their name implies, allow Web Services to be configured to access data to your specification.</p>
        <p>User defined services come in several forms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Sets – These allow you full control of the information being retrieved from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /></li>
            <li>Pages – Simple maintenance of data within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, such as hold codes on invoices.</li>
            <li>Programs – Calculation programs, such as those used in Workflow, which can be run from Web Services</li>
            <li>GET/SET – A service which allows you to GET information from any table and SET information in any table (subject to system security and Business Logic rules).</li>
        </ul>
