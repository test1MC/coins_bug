            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Calculation Field Rules</h1>
        <p>It is possible to include multiple calculations within the one calculation box -  Each calculation is separated by a ; symbol (semi-colon).  It is always the last calculation in the box which will appear on the report if the field is a calculated field.</p>
        <p>  If there is a 'Field' defined on the field record then it will be the 'Field' which is displayed although the calculations will execute.</p>
        <p>Calculations can only be performed on data of the correct type, i.e. The Test in an IF statement can only be performed on an integer or decimal value.</p>
        <p>Typical error messages which may be reported in the Log File are :</p>
        <p>"Primary expected but found string".</p>
        <p>"Invalid Character in Numeric Input …"</p>
        <p>The $ sign at the front of a variable within the calculation box will indicate that the result of the calculation is a character value.</p>
        <p class="Example" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Example: &lt;/b&gt;">
            <br />var- 	A simple variable will expect a numerical value.<br />$var - 	defines the variable var as a string – it will therefore expect character format data and should be in quotes.</p>
