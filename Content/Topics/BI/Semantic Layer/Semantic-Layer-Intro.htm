        <h1>Semantic Layer - Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Semantic Layer provides a means by which users may create <a href="../Datasets/Datasets - Overview.htm" target="_popup" class="Popup">Datasets</a> for use in reporting and analytics without the need to write data queries.  </p>
        <p>The Semantic Layer Datasets are compiled code, which brings performance benefits over the traditional OA Designer datasets. Additional licensing is required to facilitate the code compile - OpenEdge Query Results. Please check that your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> set up includes this.  
</p>

        <p class="note">The Semantic Layer is designed to allow cross-company reporting by default.  Therefore, if you wish to filter data by specific companies in your reports, you should always include the company number field in your datasets.  This is different to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA Designer Datasets where best practice is to write the dataset queries to restrict data to the currently logged in company.
