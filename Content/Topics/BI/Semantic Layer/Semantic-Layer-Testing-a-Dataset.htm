        <h1>Semantic Layer - Testing a Dataset</h1>
        <p>Once you have created your dataset with the required fields and saved, you can test it to verify the data that will be returned. </p>
        <p>Select the Data Tab.  </p>
        <p>This will present a page that will allow you to run a query against the database using the Dataset fields you specified.  A Selection page is generated with any required fields displayed first (mandatory fields highlighted in yellow) and a series of drop-down fields where you may choose any of the fields you selected and run From, To and Matches values against them to test the results of your Dataset.  </p>
