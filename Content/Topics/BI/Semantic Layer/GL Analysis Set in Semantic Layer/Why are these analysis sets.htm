            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Why are these analysis sets useful </h1>
        <p>The “old” GL Analysis sets applied to the GL Account string that included all the elements. This was a maintenance problem because of the number of GL Element combinations can create a very large number of accounts.</p>
        <p>The new GL Element Analysis Sets (up to 8 on each Element) reduces the maintenance and improves reporting because the List of codes for each Element is a more manageable number.</p>
        <h2>They are hidden until you set them up </h2>
        <p>To avoid “too many” analysis fields appearing in the Report Builder, they do not appear by default to prompt users of their existence. They need to be set up as described in this document. </p>
