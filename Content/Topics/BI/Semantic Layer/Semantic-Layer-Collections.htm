        <p class="IndentBold">The problem: </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> data is stored in a large number of data tables. Finding data you need by looking through multiple tables, and many fields within each table, can be very time consuming, and does require a level of familiarity with the database that can take a long time to acquire. Once you know where the data is, writing queries to collect the data from multiple tables can be quite technical, and is often beyond the knowledge of an Excel savvy business user. 
</p>
        <p class="IndentBold">The Solution: </p>
        <p>Collections aim to solve this problem, by providing a Business View of data as a simple list of fields with business friendly terminology. Behind the scenes, the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Collection is usually querying many COINS tables. 
Collections can be modular based, (for example data for Suppliers, Costs or House Plots) or several Collections may be available looking at data from different perspectives (for example, a Collection may be available for all costs, a collection for Cost transactions, a Collection for Revenue transactions, and a Collection for Commercial Manager based Costs CVR etc.).
Collections provide the user with a selection of pre-defined data to select for inclusion as fields within their datasets.

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>From the Collections page, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> standard collections are prefixed %.  </p>

        <p class="note">Any Collections not prefixed with % will be bespoke to your company.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If you are familiar with the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> table names, you can search for a Collection by using the Master file names such as %AVM for Suppliers, %JOB for Contracts and %VSI for Site data.  You may also search for suitable Collections using the Description.  </p>
        <p>A third column, Tags, is available which will allow you to filter the collections by Group type such as Financials, Procurement or House Building (Use the advanced filter to allow this).</p>
