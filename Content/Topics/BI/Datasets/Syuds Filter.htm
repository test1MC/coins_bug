            <MadCap:concept term="OA Designer;Datasets;Topics" />Syuds.Filter</h1>
        <p>This method causes the contents of a dataset to be copied to an identical dataset except that the records in the output dataset are filter based on a condition passed to the method.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Method('syuds.filter','CostRev','tdate="31/01/13"','CostRevJan');</span>
        </p>
        <p>The parameters are table name, condition, output table name.</p>
        <p>The above example would take records from ttCostRev and filter on a condition clause where field tdate was equal to 31/01/13.&#160; The output records would be in ttCostRevJan which would have the same fields as ttCostRev.</p>
        <p>This method is useful on inline reports to filter out a set of records from the containing report for processing or display on the inline.&#160; See also delete() method to delete this dataset once it has been used.</p>
        <p>Also useful to filter a set of records in to a new temp table before storing using store().</p>
