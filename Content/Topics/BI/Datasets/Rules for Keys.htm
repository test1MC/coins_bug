        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Datasets" />It is possible to summarise DataSets by adding a ‘KEY’. If the query is looking at all Contract (jc_job) records but the requirement in the report is to be by Contract Location then a ‘KEY’ can be set at kco/jcl_loc (ie: Tick the Key box on both of these fields). In this instance only one record will be created on a unique find of Company/Contract Location. Any numerical fields are accumulated whilst character fields are assigned where there is common data where records share the same ‘Key’ details. (If it finds character fields which differ then the value of the field will be blank).</p>
        <p>If there is a requirement to do a calculation once all of the records for the ‘Key’ are</p>
        <p>accumulated then you can <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the ‘Recalculate Summary’. (Eg: An example of where this might be required is when a percentage is required).</p>
        <p>Note: Any field which is used as a key CANNOT have a value of blank.</p>
