            <MadCap:concept term="OA Designer;Topics" />Report Pre-Processing (Syuds)</h1>
        <p>Reports in OA have mainly been banded or grouped row reports.&#160; There are a few hard coded exceptions where a grid or matrix of data is presented over a number of pages of the report.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Datasets" />Pre-Processing provides a generic mechanism to pivot a set of data in to columns and if required to page over multiple pages to allow any dataset to be processed in to further datasets that are suitable for printing in OA as matrix of data.</p>
        <p>Further pre-processing methods are also provided to manipulate the data set (temp tables), however they are produced, and create further temp tables with the processed data.&#160; Methods are provided for Union, Merge, and Sum.&#160; There is also a debug option provided to dump the contents of a dataset to the log file and a Store option to store a dataset in a datamart extract.</p>
