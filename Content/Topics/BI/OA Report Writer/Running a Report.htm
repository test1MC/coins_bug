        <p>Choose how you want <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to produce the report:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the report requires selection criteria, you can select which data to include on the report.&#160; For example, if there is a contract selection tab, you can choose which contracts to report on, according to the different fields that are available on the tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Choose the type of output you want.&#160; For example, you can choose to display the report on your screen as soon as it is ready (foreground).&#160; You can choose to email the report to someone, or to have it generated at a later date or time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Next_Both.flsnp" /></p>
        <p>The report can then be accessed via the Report Status Workbench in the normal manner.</p>
