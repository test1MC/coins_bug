            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Convert to Report Designer</h1>
        <p>If you have an OA Designer <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" /> on your system, you can take a Report Writer Report and convert it to an OA Report Designer report.&#160; This will perform the same outcome as Convert to Function, but will then open the Report in OA Designer so that more complex report functionality can be added based on the original report design.</p>
        <p class="note">Please note:&#160; Once you start to make changes in OA Designer, the report cannot then be maintained in Report Writer as OA Designer reports are not backwards compatible with Report Writer.</p>
        <p>Open the desired report in Report Writer and click the Options button in the top right of the screen</p>

        <p>If the function name has already been used, you will get a Function already exists error and you will either need to ask your Administrator to delete the old version (if appropriate), or choose a different Report Code).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The function will be created and the report design will open in the OA Report Designer.&#160; </p>

        </p>
        <p>Once you have completed your design in OA Report Designer, you can advise your system administrator of the details so that they can add this to a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> menu and add the function to the required security groups (users will not be able to see the report unless they are granted security access to it).&#160; </p>
        <h2>Amending Reports that have been converted to OA Designer</h2>
        <p>Converted reports are separate to the Report Writer tool. If you need to make changes to a converted report once you have made changes in OA Report Designer, you must continue to make any additional changes in Report Designer.&#160; </p>
        <p>Reports in OA Designer are not backwards compatible with OA Report Writer.</p>
