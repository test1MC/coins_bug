            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Using RO Fields directly in a calculation</h1>
        <p>RO fields, unless exposed, cannot be selected as a column by the user.&#160; However, they may be used within a calculation in a report column which allows the report writer user to directly control how the RO field is used and can change this at any time without needing to refer to a system administrator.</p>
        <p>To create a calculated field, select ADD on the fields tab and leave the Field name blank.&#160; Enter a label for the field and within the calculation field enter the RO field and the required parameters.&#160; </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">The field must be fully qualified as table.fieldname such as jc_job.RO_ContractCosts^TD|0|&#160; <br />If the table name is not specified, the field will not work as Report Writer will assume it is a variable rather than a database field.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>A variable name will need to be assigned in the Variable column if this column is to be included in Totals, as calculations require a variable to accumulate totals.</p>
        <p>RO fields in calculations may also be passed values from sources such as input forms – if available in the query (for example period selections) using OA standard substitution {}.&#160; So if our input screen has a period field of RS_glp_fdate__2, our RO field might become: <br /><br />jc_job.RO_ContractCosts|0|{RS-glp_fdate__2}.&#160;&#160;&#160; This RO field will then generate different figures depending on the period date selected by the user when they run the report, making the report much more dynamic.</p>
