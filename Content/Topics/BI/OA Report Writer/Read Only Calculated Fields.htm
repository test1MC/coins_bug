            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Read Only (Calculated) Fields</h1>
        <p>In addition to the standard tables and fields in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> database, Open Architecture also provides access to certain calculated and non standard fields. These are known as “RO” or Read Only fields and are also fully documented in the Database Enquiry.<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p>&#160;</p></MadCap:footnote> </p>

        </p>
        <p>Although these fields have certain restrictions, they are incredibly powerful when used in enquiries and reports. For example many of the calculated fields reflect similar fields to the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> + Configurable Reporter, such as Accruals, Costs and Revenue fields. </p>
        <p>There are three main types of calculated fields :</p>
        <p>Simplethat return descriptions from associated tables</p>
        <p>Calculatedthat return calculated values from associated tables</p>
        <p>Complex(also known as parameter drive) that return calculated values from associated tables based on parameter passed to the fields</p>
