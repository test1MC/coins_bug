            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Publishing a report to Report Runner</h1>
        <p>To use this feature, you must have a Report Runner <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" /> for each user who will need to access the report – they will only be able to run the reports, not make any changes to it.&#160; </p>
        <p>Open the report in Report Writer and select the Publish Tab.</p>
        <p>Select the User Groups as required from the available list using the green and red arrows to select and deselect respectively.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>You can use the filter to find the fields you require. Simply type in a few letters of the field or label required and the list will be dynamically filtered.</p>
        <p>Those Users with access can then simply run the report from the Report Status Workbench by clicking on the link to the Report Code.</p>
