            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Adding Filters to the Report</h1>
        <p>Filters can be applied to the main report query to further refine the information that is included in, or excluded from, the report.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The First Column of the Filter Tab will provide a selection list of the fields available in the table being queried. Select the field required, the nature of the filter and the criteria against which the filter is to be applied. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">If no filter is required, select the blank entry from the drop-down list</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The second Column is the comparison list and allows you to determine the type of filter to be applied against the field you have chosen.</p>
        <p>The third column allows you to enter the value to compare against the filter field.&#160; So, in our example, to create a filter to show only dormant suppliers the filter criteria would be:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/OA Report Writer/RW-1108-0011.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="note">If you choose Matches from the comparison list, you can use a can-do (wildcard) list in the value field.&#160; So for example to include only cost codes that end with 99, select Cost Code from the Filter list, select Matches from the comparison list, and type *99 in the value field.</p>
        <p>Repeat the process for other fields you want to filter on.&#160; Note that the filters are 'AND' filters; so for example if you specify contracts where Contract Location equals London, and where Contract Manager equals John Smith, the report will only include contracts in London that are managed by John Smith.</p>
        <p>Once all filters have been assigned click the Groups Tab.</p>
