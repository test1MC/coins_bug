            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Publishing Report Writer Reports</h1>
        <p>Once a report has been created in Report Writer the author may wish to make this available to other <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> users who do not have access to Report Writer.</p>
        <p>Three options are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Publish to Report Runner – Requires a Report Runner <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" /> per user.&#160; This allows the Report Writer user to publish this report to the appropriate <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> User Groups.&#160; Those Users who have access both to the Report Runner and the defined User Group will have access to the run the Report via the Report Status Workbench.</li>
            <li>Export to Function – Creates a standard <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> function that may be added to any <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> menu by an Administrator.&#160; This requires no additional licensing.</li>
            <li>Export to Designer – Requires an OA Designer <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" />.&#160; This is the same as Export to Function, but will open the report in OA Designer for additional Report Designer functionality to be added to the report.&#160; </li>
        </ul>
