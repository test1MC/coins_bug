            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Canvas</h1>
        <p>The canvas shows the current report (work in progress – WIP).&#160; When you open a report or start a new one it is the WIP report that you are looking at and changing.&#160; Each change is saved immediately; you can leave the WIP report, quit the system and log back in and it will still be there.&#160;&#160; The WIP report can be discarded or overwritten with the report action buttons as described below; it is only when you Save or Save As that the report is saved permanently.&#160; </p>
        <p>The canvas is disabled if the Report Type is Spreadsheet Only (see Creating a New Report).</p>
