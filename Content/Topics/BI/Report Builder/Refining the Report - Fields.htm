        <p>Double-click a field to launch the field dialog.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>This allows you to set the label, width, format, alignment, bold and border and specify a calculation.&#160; (The bold and border options are also available by selecting one or more fields and pressing the corresponding buttons in the button bar.)</p>
        <p>After changing the values in the field dialog, press the OK button to have them reflected on the canvas.&#160; You can also press the Delete button to delete the field.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/Report Builder/Screen and Processing Changes_40.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>To change more than one field, select one field by clicking on it then use CTRL (or ALT for Mac) to select other fields.&#160; They are highlighted with a blue outline.&#160; Continue to hold CTRL (or ALT) and double-click one of the fields to bring up the multi field update dialog.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/Report Builder/Screen and Processing Changes_41.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>This allows you to set the label, width, format and alignment for all the fields you have selected (similar to multi-update in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA).&#160; Similarly the Delete button will delete all the selected fields.</p>
        <p>You can also select one or more fields on the canvas and press the Delete key to delete fields. You will be asked to confirm the fields should be deleted.</p>
