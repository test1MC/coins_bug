            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Filters</h1>
        <p>To create a filter, drag fields to the filters frame.&#160; The order shown is the order they will appear on the input form for the user when running the report.&#160; You can re-order the filters by dragging them within the filters frame.&#160; </p>
        <p>Double-click a filter to show the filter dialog.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The From, To and Matches columns are for the filters and act the same as normal from, to and matches filters in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed </p>
        <p>If you <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> this, the filter will be fixed (users cannot override it at run time).&#160; </p>
        <p>For example, you might use this to omit a specific joint venture company by putting !9,* in the matches column. This would mean not company 9, but all other companies.&#160; The user then might still override which of the other companies they want to see at run time but they would never see company 9. </p>
        <p>The Show option allows this fixed filter to be shown on the report selection screen (if desired).</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Preview </p>
        <p>The values that will be used at preview time only.&#160; They are not used at run time.&#160; This allows you to pick some useful data to be shown on the preview report.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Run Time </p>
        <p>Default values for the report selection screen.&#160; </p>
        <p>If you do not want to allow the user to change the filter, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the Hide option (in this case you will need to set a fixed filter).</p>

        </p>
        <p>Pressing Preview again will show the report so far.</p>

        <p>The sort/group and (preview) filtering have been applied.</p>
