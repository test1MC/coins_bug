            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Opening an Existing Report</h1>
        <p>You can open an existing report created by you (or by another user if you have the appropriate permissions).</p>
        <p>Press the Open Existing Report button <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/Report Builder/Screen and Processing Changes_2b.png" class="icon24px" />&#160; This loads the Open Existing Report dialog.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/Report Builder/Screen and Processing Changes_7.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the user who created the report and the report you want to open.</p>
        <p>To create a new report it may be easiest to open an existing report (which could be another user’s report) as above, then use the Save As button <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/Report Builder/Screen and Processing Changes_2e.png" class="icon24px" /> to save it as a new report. This also allows easier report testing – one user can create the report, then another user can copy using this method and test it.</p>
