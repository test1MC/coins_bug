            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Report Data Sources – Pre-Built Datasets</h1>
        <p>The function previously called Report Writer Query has been renamed Report Data Sources and now allows suitable data sources to be flagged as enabled for Report Builder.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Report Builder queries MUST use only datasets to extract data; they cannot perform direct queries on the database (which was allowed with Report Writer queries). </p>
