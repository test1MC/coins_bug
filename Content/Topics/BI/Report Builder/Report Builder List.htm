        <p>Report Builder List is a new function that allows you to look at all your reports (and if you have the appropriate group permissions, those of other users in your group).</p>

        </p>
        <p>You can run reports directly from this workbench or delete reports that are no longer required.&#160; (Deleting is possible in the Report Builder but only one at a time.)&#160; Here multiple reports can be deleted at the same time.</p>
        <p>You can also update the report record and give the report a function code.&#160; This will create a normal <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> function (you will need to give is a suitable function code that is unique) that can be put on a menu for other users to run the report.&#160; Once you have given it a function code you will need to grant access permissions to the function and add it to a suitable menu for users to access.</p>
