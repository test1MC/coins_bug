            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />OA Query Language</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA uses a simplified version of the Progress 4GL query language in combination with RSP's (Record Service Procedures) to extract the data for reports and enquiries (for further information on RSP's– see later in this guide).</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA uses the query to decide which records are accessed from the coins database from the database. In response to a query, the database returns a result set, which is just a list of rows containing the answers. The Page/Report Design will determine which fields from these records are displayed (either on screen or in a report).</p>
        <p>The simplest query is just to return all the rows from a table, but more often, the rows are filtered in some way to return just the answer wanted.</p>
        <p>The flexibility of relational databases allows programmers to write queries that were not anticipated by the database designers. As a result, relational databases can be used by multiple applications in ways the original designers did not foresee, which is especially important for databases that might be used for decades. This has made the idea and implementation of relational databases very popular with businesses.</p>
