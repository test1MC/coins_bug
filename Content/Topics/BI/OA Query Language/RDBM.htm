            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Relational Database Model</h1>
        <p>The model in most common use today is the relational model, which represents all information in the form of multiple related tables each consisting of rows and columns.</p>
        <p>A relational database is a database based on the relational model. Strictly speaking the term refers to a specific collection of data but it is invariably employed together with the software used to manage that collection of data. That software is more correctly called a relational database management system, or RDBMS.</p>
        <p>An important feature of relational systems is that a single database can be spread across several tables. This differs from flat-file databases, in which each database is self-contained in a single table.</p>
        <p>On Relational Database Model represents relationships by the use of values common to more than one table</p>
        <p>In the relational model some bit of information was used as a "key", uniquely defining a particular record. When information was being collected about a user, information stored in the optional (or related) tables would be found by searching for this key. For instance, if the login name of a user is unique, addresses and phone numbers for that user would be recorded with the login name as its key.</p>
