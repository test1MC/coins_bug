            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Exercise 6 - Adding Named Filters to an enquiry.</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To date we have learnt how to add Simple Filters by adding Sort Levels to the screen, we have also learnt how to add Advanced Filters by adding Fields to the Browse Filters Tab.&#160; We will now learn how to add Multi-level Filters.&#160; By adding code into the query this will get added to the end of the main query in the body table.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>Add New Filter and select the 'New' tickbox.&#160; </p>
        <p>Create a new filter for ‘Both’</p>

        <p>Add two (2) New filters for Closed Contracts and Open Contracts – (Save <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/M3 Exercises/Exercise 6 Adding Named Filters.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 14px;height: 16px;" /> each record).</p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/M3 Exercises/Exercise 6 Adding Named Filters_5.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Running the function with both named filters</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BI/M3 Exercises/Exercise 6 Adding Named Filters_6.png" style="left: 0;" alt="55.png" class="FullWidth" />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Remember that the filters work together via an AND condition – so remember to have an ALL condition on each filter so you can switch individual named filters off!</p>
