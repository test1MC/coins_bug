        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Initial design</h2>
        <p>It is important that the purpose of a workflow is clearly understood and clearly defined before any coding begins – even for simple workflows.&#160; It is vital that the steps the workflow will follow and the business roles that will be required to interact with the workflow are identified and documented as this will make writing and maintaining the workflow easier.</p>
        <p>Our first workflow is going to be very simple.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The purpose of this workflow is to automate the process of purchase order approval.&#160;</p>
        <p>The business process is that someone at a level higher than the buyer must authorise an order before it can be issued – this is Stage 1 of the workflow (S1).&#160; For this stage we do not need to know a specific person to do the approval, we simply need to identify that there is a business role for an approver – in this example we will designate this as a “Level 1 Auth”.&#160; The authoriser will be given the ability to commit the order (Process P1) at which point an email will be sent to the buyer to advise them that the order is approved – an Email Stage (E1).&#160;</p>
