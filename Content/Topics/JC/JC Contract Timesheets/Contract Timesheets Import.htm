        <h1>Contract Timesheets</h1>
        <h1>Who would use this feature? </h1>
        <p>The main benefit of this feature is that time-costs (usually for professional staff) can be allocated to the contract in a more timely fashion – if proper disciplines are in place, within a few days of each week end. This feature is designed to allow coins users to allocate time and cost at a standard rate to contracts or General Ledger accounts. Time allocation is entered by individuals on a weekly basis. Standard cost rates can be made general or varied by activity or contract. This feature’s best use is to allow users to capture and record time against contracts for professional or salaried staff, i.e. their payment is not dependent on the pre-existence of a time-sheet, rather their costs are recovered or and/or allocated just post the event. It assumes that you can calculate a standard cost per individual per hour. </p>
