        <p>It is recommended that the accounts marked (1) &amp; (2) are control accounts, probably not part of normal balance sheet reporting and that these account pairs regularly inspected for differences. </p>
        <p>Over the period (say) or a year these differences ought to be relatively small, and the value in (1) ought to exceed (2) – this means that at least costs have been over recovered. </p>
        <p>Obviously any differences need to be accounted for somewhere either as a general overheads, or pro-rated across contracts in some way. </p>
        <p>Control account (1) is determined by the timesheet employee records (see section 2) </p>
        <p>Control Account (2) is determined by your Payroll/Salaries system. </p>
        <p>By implication then it will probably be necessary to make changes to your payroll configuration. </p>
        <p>If you are using GL for financial reporting from coins, changes may be required to any configurable reports to handle these control account pairs appropriately.</p>
