        <p>Generally standard costs are based on the individual’s employment costs divided by a certain budgeted or expected re-chargeable days or hours,</p>

        <p>The drawback with such exact methods that if this is done on an individual basis then </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Every time the employee’s salary changes then so too will his or her cost rate </li>
            <li>Coins, holds these costs and hours in cost transactions; therefore it will not take a mathematical genius to work out how much other employees are paid. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Better then, for this reason that, a grading or banding method is used to work out standard costs, e.g. all Junior Surveyors are costed at <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />35.00 per hour, or anyone in the salary band <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />25,000 to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />34,999 is costs at <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />31.25 per hour. Also note that not all activities need to carry a cost. </p>
        <p>Depending on the algorithm you choose it is likely that certain overhead activities would carry a zero cost, i.e. you are using the system to record such time. </p>
        <p>These kind of activities would be holidays, sickness, unpaid non-chargeable overtime etc.</p>
