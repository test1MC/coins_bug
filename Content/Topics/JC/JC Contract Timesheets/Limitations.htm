            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Limitations </h1>
        <p>This feature expects at least a full-days’ time to be entered for each employee otherwise it will report an incomplete day. </p>
        <p>This feature expects time records to be entered weekly, probably by individuals themselves, but not necessarily. As stated above it makes use of a “standard cost” and cannot easily be adjusted for the “actual cost”.</p>
        <p>Because of this, in some contracts with clients such a basis may not be acceptable. </p>
        <p>This is not easily usable as a means of time-sheet input for payroll purposes. </p>
