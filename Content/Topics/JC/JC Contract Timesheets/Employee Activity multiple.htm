        <p>In addition you may need to make more global changes to rates and activities.</p>
        <p>You will find the “Global Update of Employee Rates” in the administration menu.</p>
        <p>This feature can be used to report on Employee activity rates by not ticking the “Update Records” box.</p>
        <p>When used in update mode (i.e. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the “Update Records” box) it can operate in several ways using the selection box at the foot of the screen:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Change the standard cost from one value to another – unconditionally.</li>
            <li>Change the standard cost from one value to another – conditionally by ticking the “Match Rate” box.</li>
            <li>Create 1 or a group of activities and rates if you dot the “Create new records” button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This example shows changing the hourly rate to 30.50 for all employees’ activities whose current rate is 30.00 and employee code begins “B”.</p>

        </p>
        <p>An Audit report will be generated confirm the changes made.</p>
        <p>NB Costs are stamped on each time-sheet record at the time the record is created so this process will not change cost rates for pre-existing un-posted timesheet records. </p>
