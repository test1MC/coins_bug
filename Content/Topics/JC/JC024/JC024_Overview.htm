        <p class="Body">The <span class="Function">Daily Reports </span>function has a <strong>Deliveries </strong>tab that allows COINS&#160;OA&#160;users to see all the information about deliveries for a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.gang" />. However, since many supervisors review <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Gang caps" /> Daily Reports in the <span class="Function">Review and Approval </span>function, changes have been made in that function in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract caps" /> Status to allow users to also view the information about Deliveries for a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.gang" />. Changes were also made in Project Management to allow users to view Deliveries information for a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.gang" /> in the <span class="Function"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Gang caps" /> Daily Reports</span> function.</p>
        <p class="Body">This document describes the changes that were made in both modules to provide users with this functionality.</p>
