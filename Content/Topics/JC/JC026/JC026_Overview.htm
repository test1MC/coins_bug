        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1">Overview</h1>
        <p class="Body">Previously, a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract caps" /> Number was entered on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Gang caps" /> Daily Report (CDR) Header, which meant the CDR could hold data for one <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract caps" />. An enhancement was made so that the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract caps" /> Number is entered on CDR detail lines in order to allow you to enter Daily Reports for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Gangs caps" /> that worked on different <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contracts caps" /> during the day. </p>
        <p class="Body">This document details the changes that have been made in both <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract caps" /> Status and Project Management to support this enhancement.</p>
