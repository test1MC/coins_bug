        <p>Home builders who provide home construction warranty and insurance through NHBC need to submit data regarding their reservations, exchanges and completions every month as part of the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD). Changes have been made in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to manage the process of making regular submissions. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will communicate with the NHBC interface via a new web service.</p>
