        <p> 	Standard report scheduling allows you to set up this process to run at specified times.
Standard Development selection allows you to run the submission process for selected sites only.</p>
        <p>When run, the report collates information for all relevant changes to selected sites and their plots since the last submission was made. Only sites with a populated NHBC Builders Site Ref/SNIN will be included, and only plots whose sales classification is listed in the new parameter <span class="parameter">NHBCSCLS</span> will be included (or if the parameter is blank then all plots will be included). If no change has occurred on a plot since the previous submission, it will be excluded from both the report and the submission.</p>
        <p>Any records with errors are shown together in a section at the top of the report.
</p>
        <h2>Buildmark Policy Number</h2>
        <p>Whenever a plot is submitted, NHBC’s Buildmark Policy Number is returned and is stored against the plot (in the <span class="field">Certificate Number</span> field on the Plots tab of the <span class="function">Sales Workbench</span>).</p>
