        </p>
        <p>The <span class="field">Sales Extras</span> price field is replaced with a new <span class="field">Chargeable Choices</span> field which shows the total value of all the choices to be charged to the purchaser.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.2 ">Choices Summary Tab</h2>
        <p>The choices summary tab uses the new choices functionality, and also shows the <span class="field">Choice Sales Status</span> and <span class="field">Choice Construction Status</span> fields. The amount fields show the total values of all the choices to be charged to the purchaser.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.3 ">Choices Tab</h2>
        <p>The extras and options tabs are replaced with a single new Choices tab.  This is a browse of the choices to be installed on the plot, including the standard specification and the selected customer choices.</p>
