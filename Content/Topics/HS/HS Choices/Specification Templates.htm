        <p><span class="function">Specification Templates</span> allows you to set up pre-configured combinations of areas, items and choices. This reduces the effort required to configure the specifications and choices available for a development, house type or plot. </p>
        <p>When you have created a template record, the <span class="function">Generate Template</span> option allows you to populate the template with selected standard specification areas, items and choices. You can also add or update these manually.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>When you add a new area, the standard specification items linked to the specification area, and the standard choices associated with each item, are also added.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you add a new item, the standard specification choices linked to the specification item are also added.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Pricing tab allows you to override specific prices from the standard choice price. It shows a browse of all the choices contained in the template that are marked as Chargeable Choice. </p>
        <p>If a choice has a single price, you can update it on the browse. If the choice is priced by number of bedrooms or floor area, the link in the <span class="field">Level</span> column allows you to update the price breakdown.</p>
