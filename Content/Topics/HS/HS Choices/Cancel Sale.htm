This shows all the customer free and chargeable choices that have been selected on which the construction status is not complete.</p>
        <p>When the reservation is cancelled, a copy of all the selected purchaser choices is stored against the cancellation.</p>
        <p>Any chargeable choices that have been fitted and were selected by the purchaser are retained against the plot so they show as part of the specification of the plot.  The pricing status is set to either ‘Free of Charge’ or ‘Chargeable Choice’ (as determined by the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>HS parameter <span class="parameter">CHOCHGCS</span>).   The Selected By for these retained choices is set to Previous Reservation.  Any other choices selected by the purchaser are removed from the plot.  Standard specification choices and Home Builder selected choices are retained against the plot.</p>
