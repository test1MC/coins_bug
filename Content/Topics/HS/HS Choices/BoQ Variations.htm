        <p style="page-break-after: avoid;">The new Choices functionality is linked to the <span class="function">Boq Variations Workbench</span> if the new HS parameter <span class="parameter">CHOBQVAR</span> is set to Y.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Variation Reasons</h2>
        <p>If the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>choices functionality is in use, a <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>system reason of ‘Client Choice’ is available, and the ‘Client Extra’, ‘Client Incentive’ and ‘Client Option’ reasons are removed.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.2 ">Variation Detail</h2>
        <p>When selecting a variation, if the variation reason is of type ‘Client Choice’ a new ‘Customer Choices’ tab is displayed.  This shows a list of all the changes to customer choices that have occurred.  From here you can assign the choice to the variation.</p>
        <p>Actions allow you to assign the choice to the variation, removed it from the variation, or flag it as ‘Variation Not Required’.   When the choice is assigned to a variation or flagged as not required, if a construction status code has been set up as ‘Default BoQ Variation’, the construction status for the choice is set to this status.</p>
        <p>You need to amend the bill items to reflect the choice.</p>
