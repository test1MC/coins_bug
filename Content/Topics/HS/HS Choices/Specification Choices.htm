        <p><span class="function">Specification Choices</span> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">is a new function that </MadCap:conditionalText>allows you to input the detailed choices a customer can make.  For example, the choice of kitchen units or worktops.</p>

        </p>
        <p>An add-type selector allows you to choose between adding a standard choice and a bespoke choice.</p>
        <p>Details of a specification choice include how the choice can be user (whether it is standard, no cost or chargeable), how it is priced, and when it must be chosen or installed. See the side-frame help for details of individual fields.</p>

        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Images for Choices</h2>
        <p>The paperclip button allows you to upload images for each choice. Assign one image to the “thumbnail” document group, and assign others to the “images” document group. The thumbnail shows as a small image against the choice on the <span class="function">Customer Choices</span> screen, and a larger version, along with any other images attached to the choice, can be viewed by clicking the thumbnail. The <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>HS parameters <span class="parameter">CHODMGRP</span>	and <span class="parameter">CHODMTN</span> determine the document groups to use for images and thumbnails respectively.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.2 ">Price Breakdown</h2>
        <p>Choices can have a single price, or be priced by number of bedrooms or the floor area of the plot. If the <span class="field">Pricing Method</span> is set to <span class="userselect">Number of Bedrooms</span> or <span class="userselect">Floor Area</span>, a link on the <span class="field">Choice</span> column opens the <span class="function">Specification Choice Price Breakdown</span> screen, which allows you to enter the price breakdown for the choice.</p>
