            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Quick Add Plot Address</h1>
        <p>A Development can have a number of plots. Users will need to add an address for each plot within a Development. If there are many number of plots this can be extremely time consuming as you will need to add the plot address individually for each plot. 

There is a quick add address option within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> which allows you to add an address for multiple plots.
