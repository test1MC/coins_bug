        <p>Development Maintenance allows Users to set up and maintain details of a development and the plots on that development.</p>
        <p>Before you can set up a Development with the House Sales Module it needs to be created in both the Central Repository (Project Workbench) and Contract Status Ledger.&#160; Both of these actions are normally carried out by the Finance Department who will inform you of the Contract / Development Number.</p>
