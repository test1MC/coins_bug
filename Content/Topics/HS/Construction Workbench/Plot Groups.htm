            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Plot Groups</h1>
        <p>The Development Maintenance - Plot Groups tab allows you to maintain the plot groups on this development.&#160; Plot groups allow you to group plots together for reporting purposes, for example, to group all the plots in a block of flats together.</p>
        <p>Set up plot groups for the development, then indicate which group a plot belongs to using the Plot Group field when updating a plot.</p>
        <p>Not all plots need to belong to a group; for example, if you are building houses and blocks of flats on the same development, the house plots might not belong to a group.</p>
        <p>Plot Groups are Development specific.</p>
