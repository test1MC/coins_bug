]]><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">is a new tool that </MadCap:conditionalText>allows you to migrate data from the existing hard-coded data consent fields to the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>configurable consent fields. This needs to be run when the data consent categories have been configured, otherwise people’s exsiting consent 
will not be taken into account.</p>

        <p>For each of the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>configurable consent categories you can select the default value for the category. You can also set the value for the source of consent for the consent fields that have been updated.</p>
        <p>Against each consent category you can select one of the following values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unknown (This is the default value).</li>
            <li>Yes</li>
            <li>No</li>
            <li>Do Not Email - This sets the value of the consent category on each person record based on the current value of the ‘Do Not Email’ flag. If the consent category has been mapped to ‘Do Not Email’ then this option is selected by default.</li>
            <li>Do Not Mail - This sets the value of the consent category on each person record based on the current value of the ‘Do Not Mail’ flag. If the consent category has been mapped to ‘Do Not Mail’ then this option is selected by default.</li>
            <li>Do Not SMS - This sets the value of the consent category on each person record based on  the current value of the ‘Do Not SMS’ flag. If the consent category has been mapped to ‘Do Not SMS’ then this option is selected by default.</li>
            <li>Consent to Use Details - This sets the value of the consent category on each person record based on the current value of the ‘Consent to Use Details’ flag. If the consent category has been mapped to ‘Consent to Use Details’, then this option is selected by default.</li>
            <li>Consent for Third Party Use - This sets the value of the consent category on each person record based on the current value of the ‘Consent for Third Party Use’ flag. If the consent category has been mapped to ‘Consent for Third Party Use’ then this option is selected by default.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The consent audit details text will show an entry like the following:&#160;“Data consent migration.  Consent set to Yes.  Source set to Z”.</p>
