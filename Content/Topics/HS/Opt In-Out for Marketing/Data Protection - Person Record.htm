        <p style="page-break-after: avoid;">If the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>HS parameter <span class="parameter">DPCONCAT</span> is set to Yes, when you update a person record any data consent categories that have been configured are displayed. These allow you to record whether or not consent has been given. The <span class="field">Source</span> field against each category allows you to select one of the configured data consent sources.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_G-I/HS/Opt In-Out for Marketing/Person Record Consent Fields.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>You can also enter a note or comment when any of the consent values are updated. The <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>HS parameter <span class="parameter">DPNOTENEW</span> determines whether you receive an error or a warning if you update the consent values and do not enter a note.</p>
        <p>Each time the value of a consent category or its source is changed; an audit of the change is kept (see <MadCap:xref href="Opting In-Out for Direct Marketing - Auditing.htm">1 - Opting In-Out for Direct Marketing - Auditing</MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <p>If the Person table (pp_person) is configured in Document Management, the <span class="field">Data Consent Document</span> button is available. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_G-I/HS/Opt In-Out for Marketing/Person Record Consent Fields+Button.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>This allows you to load any document that supports proof of the consent given.  Clicking this button opens a desktop frame where you can upload a file.  Once uploaded the file name will be shown next to the upload button.  You can only upload one document per update.</p>
        <p>When the person record is saved or updated person record, the uploaded document will then be loaded against the person record in Document Manager.  The consent audit records will also contain a link to the document so it can be viewed from the new auditing tab (see <MadCap:xref href="Opting In-Out for Direct Marketing - Auditing.htm">1 - Opting In-Out for Direct Marketing - Auditing</MadCap:xref>).</p>
