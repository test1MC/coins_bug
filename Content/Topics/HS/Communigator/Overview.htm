        <p>The interface to Communigator has been changed to use web services, making it easier and quicker to implement.  In addition, details of web site visits and other responses to campaigns are now fed back into <span class="module">House Sales</span>.</p>
        <p>These changes will help you with GDPR compliance as the Communigator interface allows your customers to opt out (unsubscribe) from marketing campaigns, and updates the consent held in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
