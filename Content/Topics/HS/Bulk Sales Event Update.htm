        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Bulk Sales Event Update allows you to run a single sales event against multiple plots on a site, but from just one screen. The selection criteria allow you to narrow down the list of plots against which an event can be run.</p>
        <p>This is usually run after importing development and plot details into a new company (kco).</p>
        <p>Navigate to <span class="Function">House Sales &gt; Plot Sales &gt; Bulk Sales Event Update</span></p>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select the development to be updated</li>
            <li>Select the Event you want to update and the criteria of the plots to be modified. Depending on the event chosen, the list of plots against which it can be run will be modified so that only plots with an appropriate sales status for this event will be displayed.</li>
            <li>If you only want to include plots with a specific sales status or sales classification, select the relevant statuses by ticking or unticking the selections</li>
            <li>Click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Next_Both.flsnp" /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The next screen will show all the relevant plots based on the selection criteria.</p>

            <li>On the next screen you can enter the event details</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Save_Both.flsnp" /> to update the selected plots</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once the bulk update has completed, you can continue to update the plots individually, taking each plot through to the stages required.</p>
