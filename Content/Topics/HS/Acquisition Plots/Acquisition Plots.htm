        <p>The Plot/Person Add function in Customer Care allows you to add a plot and purchaser (or other contact) to the Customer Care workbench quickly, without having to enter the plot and process the purchase in House Sales. This process creates a non-sellable plot record.</p>
        <p>You can also quickly add a contact to an existing plot.</p>
        <p>This can be used after an acquisition, for adding plots whose warranty you are still responsible for, or for data take on when setting up <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Customer Care.</p>
