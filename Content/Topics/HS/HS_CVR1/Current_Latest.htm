        <p>One <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR" /> must be flagged as ‘Current’ in every Period that a CVR is created for a contract (NB. It is possible to create multiple <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVRs" /> in a period).&#160; If a CVR requires data from a previous period CVR it will use the one flagged as Current for that period.</p>
        <p>One <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR" /> must be flagged as ‘Latest’ for a contract.&#160; If a CVR is flagged as Latest it will be available via a hyperlink on the main CVR Workbench; this removes the need to drilldown via a contract number to find it.&#160; This flag can also be used to point users to the latest finished CVR (i.e. a further CVR could be created but not flagged as Latest until it is finished).</p>
