        <h1><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Licence caps" /> Setup</h1>
        <h2>&#160;</h2>
        <p>First you will need to setup a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> user id that is set up for web services.&#160; You can only do this through OA User Maintenance.&#160; You need to ensure that the ‘Webservices’ box is <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed.&#160; See below:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Note the number of users that can be set up for web services is controlled by the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" /> for module code NWS.&#160; </p>
        <p>You will also need to ensure that you have the required <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licences" /> for the House Sales Connection Enquiry (NHSE) and optionally the House Sales Connection Update (NHSU).&#160; See below:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_G-I/HS/HS-web/HS-WS0002-1108.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licences" /> for the modules NHSE and NHSU control the maximum number of developments that can made available through the HS connection interface.&#160; Note on some older patches of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> you may need to add these modules into the list.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You will also need to obtain a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" /> to be able to run the individual web service objects, this should be entered on the ‘Extras’ tab in module <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" /> maintenance.&#160; See below:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_G-I/HS/HS-web/HS-WS0003-1108.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Under the X-WSERVICE extra you need to specify a list of the soap objects you are licensed for.&#160; To run all the HS connection objects you can specify a can-do list e.g. hsws*</p>
        <p>Note this ‘Extras’ screen forms part of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" /> control cross check and you should ensure that you obtain the correct <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" /> certificate with the soap objects you want to run from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> before amending this screen.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Once the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" /> have been obtained, you will then need to indicate which developments are available for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquiry" /> and update access.&#160; A new maintenance browse ‘Connection <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licences" style="text-transform: capitalize;" />’ in OA has been produced for this.&#160; This can be fond under the OA House Sales/Plot Sales menu.&#160; See below:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_G-I/HS/HS-web/HS-WS0004-1108.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note on patches prior to 0609 this will not be on a menu.&#160; You will need to add the function %WVP2111BVSI to an OA menu.</p>
