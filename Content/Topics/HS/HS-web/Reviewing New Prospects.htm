        <h1>Reviewing New Prospects</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Prospects Workbench includes a new option to review new prospects received via the HS connection interface.&#160; This allows you the option to check for duplicates and allows the option of merging new details with a current prospect record already in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.&#160; The ‘To Review’ tab shows a list of new prospects received see below:</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>From here you can either mark them as reviewed using the ‘Choose action’ or select to view the possible duplicates by clicking on the link in the ‘Possible Duplicates’ column.</p>
        <p>Clicking on the possible duplicates link will then take you to a screen which shows a list of potential duplicates and details the fields that match.&#160;</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>If you want to merge the new record with one of these potential duplicates then click on the relevant merge button in the right hand column.&#160; You will then be presented with a screen where  you can then choose the fields to merge and also revise the level of interest.&#160; Merging the records will update the current record with the selected new information and then delete the new prospect record.</p>
