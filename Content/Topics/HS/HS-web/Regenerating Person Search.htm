        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For existing users on a version of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> before 10.11 the database search field we store against a person record will need to be regenerated.&#160; The information held in this search field now includes the email address; this is to allow fast location of a person by their email address via the new web services.</p>
        <p>The existing regenerate procedure hs903.p has been enhanced to include this.&#160; This can be run by pressing . at a COINS+ menu and entering the program hs903.p</p>
