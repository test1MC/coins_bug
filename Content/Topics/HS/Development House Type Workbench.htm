            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" /><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Vp Site caps" /> House Type Workbench</h1>
        <p class="Body">The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Vp Site caps" /> House Type Workbench works similar to the Standard House Type Workbench, the focus however is shifted to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Vp Sites caps" /> rather than Standard House Types, meaning that the house types at this level as specific against the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Vp Site caps" />.</p>
        <p class="Body">When you first click on the development house type workbench you are presented with the different developments that are currently on the system, you are able to then select the development resources by house types that are applicable to this development.</p>
        <p class="Body">

        </p>
        <p class="Body">Within the Development House type workbench, you have a number of tabs that slightly differ from the standard house type workbench.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Summary Views</h2>
        <p class="Body">The Summary views emulate the matrix views, this functionality allows you to give read only access to users, enabling them to see the matrix views but only able to filter, sort and find information on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" />.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Development Items</h2>
        <p class="Body">Just like the Standard House type items workbench, the development items allow you to add, delete and modify resources, it automatically adds in the information to the payment stages tab and where applicable the intelligent resources.</p>
        <p class="Body">To Add a resource, ensure that the ‘add type’ on the workbench is set to ‘Resource Line’</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../BQ/BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_5.png" class="FullWidth">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body">if you now click on ADD, you’ll be taken to a screen where you’ll be able to add a new resource.</p>
        <p class="Body">There are 4 main parts to the adding of a resource to the house type item tab. These are ‘Item Selection’, ‘Pricing Details’, ‘Other Details’ and ‘Ordering Details’, an example of what could be input is below;</p>
        <h3>Item Selection</h3>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../BQ/BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_6.png" class="FullWidth">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body">it is worth noting that within the <span class="Heading4Char">Pricing Details</span> you <span class="span_4">MUST</span> ensure that the ‘status’ is set to ‘Not Applicable’ against the categories that aren’t being used and also ensure that the ‘item ready to use’ <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> box is not ticked.</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../BQ/BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_7.png" class="FullWidth">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body">Other Details is more memo data rather than specifically affecting anything to do with the resource and useage of it.</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../BQ/BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_8.png" class="FullWidth">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body">It is important to ensure that the <span class="Heading4Char">ordering details</span> is filled out and that a resource is associated to either a material or subcontract package, this allows you to view the resources against the individual plots within the surveyor workbenches, <span class="span_5">this must be associated</span></p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../BQ/BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_9.png" class="FullWidth">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body">once you are happy with your resource you can click ‘SAVE’, once it is saved, the screen will blank out all of the details you have just entered, this is so that you can add a new resource without navigating away. To navigate away from this click ‘UNDO’ at the bottom right hand side of the screen. You will eventually have a screen that looks like this;</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../BQ/BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_10.png" class="FullWidth">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body">This in total is what makes up your development house type, all resources should now be part of this screen.</p>
        <h2>Options</h2>
        <p class="Body">The Options menu within the Development workbench is a lot more detailed than what is in the Standard house type workbench. It allows you to apply the house type changes to plot level, which is required to order items against each plot, you are also able to update the VAP budget, Substitute resources that have been marked as substitutable or view setup of the material, subcontract or plant packages. There are also three reports specific to developments that can be obtained from this menu.</p>
        <p class="Body">&#160;</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../BQ/BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_35.png" class="FullWidth">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Body">it is <span class="span_5">essential </span>that you apply house type changes to plots, as this copies the item per plot allowing you to specify quantity and prices individually if needed. It is worth noting that any changes you do at this level also flags up in the header of the screen that ‘unapplied house type changes’ exist. This can be seen below;</p>
