        <p>The following changes have been made to improve the user experience for home building clients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <span class="function">BQ Apply Prices ...</span> options have been removed from the <span class="function">Prices Workbench</span>.</li>
            <li>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Pc Plant caps" /> drop-down has been removed from both the <span class="function">Surveyors Plot <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq boq" /></span> and <span class="function">Buyers <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq boq" /></span> Workbenches.</li>
            <li>A new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box, <span class="field">Lock Budget,</span> has been added to <span class="function">Update VAP Budget</span> on the <span class="function">Development House Type <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq boq" /> Workbench</span>. If this is <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed, the selected budget will be locked at the end of the update process.</li>
            <li>On the <span class="function">House Type <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq boq" /></span> Workbenches and the <span class="function">Surveyors Plot <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq boq" /> Workbench</span>, additional statuses (Estimated, Free and Not applicable) are now shown.</li>
            <li>Column sets have been added to the <span class="function">Standard House Types</span>, <span class="function">Development House Types</span> and <span class="function">Development Maintenance</span> screens.</li>
            <li>In <span class="function">Development House Types</span>, a new <span class="function">Rebuild from Standard House Type</span> option allows both specifications and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost heads" /> for the development house type to be rebuilt based on the related standard house type.</li>
            <li>The Invoice Register menu has been removed from the VAP Input menu, as it is redundant.</li>
            <li>Two new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />boxes have been added to the <span class="function">Sales Staff</span> details: <span class="field">Maintained in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Customer Care caps" /></span> and <span class="field">Maintained in House Sales</span>. Two new functions, <span class="function"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Customer Care caps" /> Staff</span> and <span class="function">House Sales Staff</span>, allow menu security to be used to prevent staff of one type from being able to amend the records of staff of a different type. The existing <span class="function">Sales Staff</span> screen continues to show all records, providing a means of updating all records centrally. A new column, <span class="field">Maintained By</span>, shows 'Both', 'Customer Care' or 'Sales'.</li>
        </ul>
