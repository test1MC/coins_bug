            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Deleting <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Hs Prospects caps" /> (Bulk)</h1>
        <p>Over time, home builders using <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> HB CRM will build up a database of many <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hs prospect" /> and people records.  Under <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="COINS.Term5">GDPR</MadCap:glossaryTerm> you should only retain records where there is a legitimate reason.   There may be no reason to retain old <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hs prospect" /> records, so you can use <span class="function">Bulk Delete Prospects</span> to delete <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hs prospect" /> and people records on which there has been no recent activity.</p>

        <p>If report mode has not been selected, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hs prospects" /> records will be deleted.  If the associated people also have no other links to any other <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> record in any <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />, the people information workbench records will also be deleted.</p>
