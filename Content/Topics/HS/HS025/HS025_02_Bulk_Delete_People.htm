            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Deleting People (Bulk)</h1>
        <p>The  <span class="function">People Information Workbench</span> contains records of people that are associated with other records in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, such as contact records or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.hs prospect" /> records. If the associated records are deleted, the people records are not necessarily also deleted. Under <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="COINS.Term5">GDPR</MadCap:glossaryTerm> you should only retain records where there is a legitimate reason, so you can use <span class="function">Bulk Delete People</span> to delete people records that are not linked to any other <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> record.</p>
