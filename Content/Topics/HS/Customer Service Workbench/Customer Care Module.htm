        <p>The purpose of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Customer Care caps" /> Module is primarily to assist with the management of after-sales issues that may arise once a purchaser has occupied their new property. The procedures within this workbench enable users to record and handle customer issues and also help to ensure that any such issues are tracked thoroughly and carried through to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
        <p>If a purchaser has reserved a property and the details have been recorded in either the Sales Workbench or the Part Exchange Workbench, then the purchaser's details are automatically made available in this workbench as well.</p>
