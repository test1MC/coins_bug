A new style of VAP matrix has been introduced which is easier and faster to use, and allows you to update the matrix screens like a spreadsheet. You can quickly scroll up, down, left and right, and update single cells, or highlight multiple cells and update them. "Go to" options allow you to jump to individual cells. Updates are saved as you enter them, but there are options to undo changes to cells, rows, columns and the entire matrix.
