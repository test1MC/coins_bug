        <p class="Body">Many of the new matrix screens are available from new workbench selection screens, rather than having separate menu items for each matrix screen.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Function">Development Budget Workbench</span> allows you to see all available budgets on all your developments, with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.colour" />-coding to identify the current status of each available (empty, unlocked or locked) . From here you can select an individual budget. The budget screen includes two tabs, one for the Development House Type Budget and one for the Development Plot Budget.</p>
