        <p class="Body">The only valuation methods that are supported by the new matrix screens are <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> group valuations and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost head" /> valuations. If you have previously used a different method of valuation, we recommend you configure <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> groups to provide the required level of detail at which to do your valuations. Some (or all) tick groups can be set to value in detail if required.</p>
