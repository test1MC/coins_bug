        <h1>VAP Overview</h1>
        <p>VAP stands for Valuations and Automated Payments.  VAP is concerned with recording the progress of work done on a house-building site and paying subcontractors for the work done.</p>
        <p>The main business processes that VAP supports are:</p>
        <p>Recording the progress of work on site.  Surveyors can record in detail the progress of work against the construction programme. A number of industry-standard valuation and approval methods are available, which ensure that all surveyors work to a consistent process.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Controlling payments.  Work on individual plots can be measured against pre-defined build stages, and payments authorised accordingly.   This helps ensure that subcontractors are paid correctly for the work they have done and avoids duplicated payments.</li>
            <li>Recording materials on site.  This provides a true picture of the value of the site, and feeds into the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR" />.</li>
            <li>Calculating accruals.  If subcontract work has been valued but not certified, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> calculates an accrual figure; this can be fed into the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR" />.</li>
            <li>Handling of dayworks and variations.</li>
        </ul>
