        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> provide an English language technical support service for authorised customer representatives to raise issues by Remedy Force or phone during the hours of service as defined in the Service Notification Pack.&#160; </p>
        <p>All issues are logged in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> problem logging system, assigned a unique reference number for tracking and reporting purposes and assigned an initial severity category as defined below.</p>
        <p>NOTE… Telephone and email systems cannot be relied on to be 100% available.&#160; Until you have a reference number you should not assume the issue is logged with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> and we recommend that in the event that you cannot get through by telephone (even if you leave a message), that you also log a ticket just in case.</p>
