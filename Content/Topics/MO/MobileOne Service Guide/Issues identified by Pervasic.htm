        <p>Problems may also be identified and raised by <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> in which case the customer is informed of issues affecting their service. </p>
        <p>In the event that <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> monitoring identifies a P1, P2 issue with the M1x platform or the customer’s mobile-application, then an email alert will be sent within the A1 times listed above and then the issue will be treated as though reported by the customer.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Issues with the Customer Managed Environment</h2>
        <p>In the event that <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> monitoring identifies an issue that is the customer’s responsibility, then <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will notify this to the customer using the same categorisation.&#160;&#160; These problems will be logged but not count towards any of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> targets and <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> expect the customer to update <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> on the status of the issue through to resolution.&#160;&#160; </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> require named points and methods of contact to raise these issues to the customer within the hours of service.&#160;&#160; These names will be identified as part of service handover.</p>
        <p>If the problem is not resolved within a reasonable time period and in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> opinion, the problem is jeopardising the overall M1x platform performance, then <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> may suspend the customer’s Managed Service until the problem is resolved – <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will give written notice of this and make reasonable attempts to notify the customer in advance.</p>
