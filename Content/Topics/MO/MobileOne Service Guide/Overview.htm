            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Overview</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> M1x platform extends the functionality of customers’ back-end systems out to their mobile workers using a variety of mobile devices.&#160; <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> provide a managed service to support the operation of the platform and mobile-application:</p>
        <p>The following diagram is used to highlight a typical architecture and the scope of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> responsibilities under the managed service :</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>As the overall application seen by the mobile worker crosses responsibility boundaries, the following definitions will be used in this document:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">application – the functionality that the mobile worker accesses and that operates end-to-end through the mobile device, the contracted mobile network, the M1x platform, the integration to the customer environment and the functionality of a customer’s back-end systems.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Mobile Application – that part of the application that is developed-for and hosted-on the M1x platform.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">managed service – the services to monitor, maintain and support the operation of the Mobile Application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In using the managed service, the customer understands and recognises that the operation of the application involves elements that are not provided or managed by <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> and that the overall service is dependant on factors outside of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />' control e.g. the availability of GPRS/3G/4G/HSDPA network operator, functionality or limitations of the chosen mobile device, connectivity to and the availability/functionality of the customer’s systems.</p>
