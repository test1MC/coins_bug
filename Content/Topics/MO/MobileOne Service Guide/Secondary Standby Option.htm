            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Secondary Standby Option</h1>
        <p>The secondary standby option provides for a pre-configured secondary system offsite from the main data centre (primary).&#160;&#160; Subject to availability of customer staff to support transition, service will be restored with a target of 24 hours.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will ensure that the standby facility is checked daily for availability and is maintained with current versions of the Mobile Application as running in the production data centre.&#160;&#160; <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will also ensure that the standby facility has sufficient capacity to support customers that are contracted for this option.</p>
        <p>In the event that service is switched to the standby facility, then <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> remain committed to the Standard option and restoring the primary data centre.&#160;&#160; Subject to availability of customer staff to support transition, service will be transitioned back to the primary with a target of 5 days.</p>
        <p>The Standby option currently uses <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />' internal standby facility – this is scheduled for replacement with an off-site data centre and customers with the secondary option will be automatically transitioned to this facility.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Support for Customer Disaster Recovery Exercises</h2>
        <p>If a customer wants to undertake a disaster recovery exercise, then this can be arranged provided there is at least 2 weeks notice, is undertaken at weekends.&#160; Disaster recovery exercises should use test accounts on systems to avoid conflict with the live system data and also require that the customer’s systems are capable of supporting dual access from the primary and secondary systems.</p>
        <p>There is a charge for <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />' support of a disaster recovery exercise.</p>
