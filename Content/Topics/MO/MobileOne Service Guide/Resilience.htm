            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Resilience</h1>
        <p>The M1x platform is designed to have no single point of failure.&#160; In the event of failure of a component, then <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will either have arrangements for next day delivery of a replacement or maintain at least one spare on site in its data-centre.</p>
        <p>The Mobile Application running on the platform is typically designed with a loosely coupled architecture that provides resilience to network failures between the mobile device and the M1x platform and between the M1x platform and the customer’s back-end systems.&#160; For more details refer to the functional specification for the mobile-application.&#160;&#160; </p>
        <p>The platform is hosted in a secure data-centre that provides environment monitoring, climate control, fire protection systems and 24 hour emergency power.</p>
        <p>Any persistent data (e.g. user ids) necessary for the operation of the platform and mobile-application is backed-up daily and stored off-site.&#160; Unless otherwise stated in the service agreement or functional specification, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> have no responsibility for maintaining, archiving or otherwise securing transient data for the mobile-application that is more than 5 days old.</p>
