        <p>The Mobile Application is potentially impacted by changes to the customer’s back-end applications.&#160; Consequently in providing this service <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> expect the customer to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Provide advance notice of changes to the customer systems that may impact the mobile-application.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Provide advance notice of any scheduled down-time of the customer systems.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Test changes to back-end systems to ensure they do not impact the Mobile Application before they are put live.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">Whilst the Mx platform is designed and developed to support multiple devices and networks, changes to either should still be managed through change control as the Mobile Application will still need verification and to confirm that the device/network is supported.</p>
