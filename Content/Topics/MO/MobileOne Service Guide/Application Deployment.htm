        <p>Before the managed service can be delivered, the Mobile Application must be deployed on the production instance of M1x platform.&#160; The services to define, develop, integrate and trial the Mobile Application are covered in other documents (e.g. Agreement, functional specification, project plan etc) and undertaken by <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> professional services team or third-party developers and using non-production instances of the M1x platform.</p>
        <p>Once accepted, the Mobile Application is ready for deployment on the production instance of M1x platform and the managed service will commence as defined in the Agreement.&#160;&#160; However, it is normal for special arrangements to be in place during initial roll-out/pilot whereby the project team are actively involved for a period before the client is fully handed-over into the managed service.&#160; </p>
