        <p> The locations screen will list all the types of locations that belong to the plot. All locations are listed. Operatives can select N/A if not applicable to carry out an inspection for that location. The toggle button will change to orange against the location where N/A has been selected.</p>
        <p>All other inspections must be completed in order for the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> to close this task </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> taps on ‘applicable’, then the app will show only those that have not been as N/A.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_M-O/MO/mCare/applicable.PNG" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> wishes to return back to the main menu (Visit List screen) then they can do so by tapping on the ‘Menu button at the top left of the screen (hamburger)'. This can be done at any part of the application. The app will buffer all the data captured by the operative and allow for them to return and complete the task at any time during their log-in session. </p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>All will have the status 'NEW', for those that have already been started and not yet submitted then they will have the status 'STARTED' against them on the 'Visit List' screen.</p>

        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> could either complete this outstanding task or start a new one and come back to this at a later time.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> logs out at this point, the app will buffer all incomplete visit data onto the device allowing to user to continue during their next log-in session.</p>
