        <p>The "On Route to Site" screen is shown only if the task is not active i.e. the user is not on site (they have not started the inspection). If the user has already started the inspection (on site) then the app will not show the "On Route to Site" screen. </p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 28pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">In order to start the inspection the user will tap the On Site button. This will set this inspection visit as active task i.e. work in progress. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the user taps on "NAVIGATE" then the mCare app will launch the default navigation app that is stored on the device and use this to navigate the user to the site.</p>

        <p>Once the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> has arrived and selected "On Site" the application will show the "Actions" screen.</p>
