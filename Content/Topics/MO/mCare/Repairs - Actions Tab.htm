        </p>
        <p>After the notes have been entered the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will be prompted to confirm their action, Selecting "No" will show the "No Access" screen and selecting "Yes" will send the </p>
        <p>this back to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> and the visit will be removed from the "Visit List" screen.</p>
        <p>Tapping on the navigation icon for the visit, then the application will then launch the relevant default application on the device to complete this action with . When the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> is at their destination and selects "On Site"</p>
        <p>application will launch the "Health And Safety" screen.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 ">Repairs - Health And Safety</h1>
        <p>When the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> selects "On Site" from the "On Route to Site" screen they will be shown the "Health Ans Safety" form (if set up and configured to do so).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_M-O/MO/mCare/H&amp;S.PNG" />
        </p>
        <p>If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> has not passed the Health And Safety form, then they will be alerted that they have failed the Heath and safety survey and will not be able to proceed. </p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> can either tap "Yes" which will close the task from the device or the operative can select "No" which will allow them to return to the survey to amend any </p>
        <p>details that may have been entered incorrectly.</p>

        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 ">Repairs - Actions - ISSUES</h1>
        <p>From the "Actions" screen the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will first see the Issues tab, they can also swipe across to the "NOTES", "SIGN" and "COMPLETE" screens.</p>
        <p>The hamburger menu will always be displayed in the top right corner of the screen, this will give the user the ability to navigate their way to alternative screens.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>From the above example there are 3 issues. issue with the reference number 120 is the issue that came from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, the two additional issues were added from the device during the visit.</p>
        <p>We can see the 3 different <MadCap:variable name="Variables.colours" /> (blue, grey and green).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blue - issues that have not been given a "Complete" or "Incomplete" status. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will not be able to complete the visit without a status being selected.</li>
            <li>Grey - Incomplete</li>

        </p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will also be able to capture photo against the issue in a similar fashion to inspections.</p>
        <p>Tapping on the green add issue button will load the Issue "Add Issue" screen. Similar to adding an issue from an inspection when failing an item, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will need to enter the following </p>
        <p>details:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Description </li>

        <p>Tapping on the back or the cancel ("X") button the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will be shown the following message where they will need to confirm their action before proceeding.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_M-O/MO/mCare/unsaved issues.PNG" />
        </p>
        <p>If the issue is added it will appear on the "Actions" screen where the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will have the option to delete it. </p>
        <p>The user can continue to add additional issues.</p>

        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 ">Repairs - Actions - SIGN</h1>
        <p>Swiping left from the "NOTES" screen will take the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> to the "SIGN" screen where the signature for the visit can be obtained. </p>

        <p>Tapping on the signature field, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will be able to capture a signature, After a signature has been captures the operative can also do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cancel - Will disregard the signature that was captures</li>
            <li>Clear - Remove the signature allowing the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> to re-capture a signature </li>

        <p>Once the signature has been captured and the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> taps "SAVE", the application will prompt the operative to answer a few questions.</p>
        <p>If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> selects "No", the application will go to the "SIGN" screen where the signatures captured will be listed. However, if the operative selects "Yes" then the application will display the </p>
