        <p>When the Operative selects a location from the "Actions" screen i.e. Bedroom, Kitchen, Bathroom etc. the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will be taken to the "Inspection Items" screen </p>
        <p>where they can see the checklist items for the location.</p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_M-O/MO/mCare/Location Bedroom.PNG" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>The top of the screen will display the name of the screen ("Inspection Items") followed by the inspection reference number ("00000122"), name of the location ("Bedroom"), </p>
        <p>the check list items and at the very bottom a pass all toggle button.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Pass</li>
            <li>Fail</li>
            <li>N/A</li>
            <li>Subject-To</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Selecting "Pass all" will allow the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> to pass all items for the location. the "Pass" status will be highlighted and the "Pass all" toggle button will change to orange.</p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_M-O/MO/mCare/Inspection Pass all.PNG" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> taps on the "Fail" status, they will be taken to the "Inspection Issues" screen where they will need  to add an issue. </p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_M-O/MO/mCare/Inspection Issues.PNG" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Tapping on the add button will load the "Add Issue" screen where the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> can do the following actions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add description, this can be done by tapping on the drop down list and selecting the pre-populated selections, one of which will allow the user to enter a description manually.</li>
            <li>Select a sub-location from the drop down list </li>
            <li>select a category</li>
            <li>Select Priority</li>
            <li>Add issue notes </li>
            <li>Save</li>
            <li>Discard</li>
            <li>Capture a photo</li>
        </ul>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_M-O/MO/mCare/Add issues.PNG" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Tapping on the photo icon will give the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> the option to either attach an image from the gallery or to capture a photo using the camera. If the user selects to use the camera then the app </p>
        <p>will launch the default camera from the device. Notes can also be added against the photo. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> can delete the photo and note that they have captured by tapping on the delete icon.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> can continue to add photos depending on the limit that has been set in the configurations.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Here the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> can add another issue, view, amend or delete the issue that they had added or go back to the "Inspection Items" screen by tapping on the back button.</p>
