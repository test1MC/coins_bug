        <p>Tapping on the signature field, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will be able to capture a signature, After a signature has been captures the operative can also do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cancel - Will disregard the signature that was captures</li>
            <li>Clear - Remove the signature allowing the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> to re-capture a signature </li>
            <li>OK - Saves the signature that has been captured</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Once the signature has been captured and the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> taps "SAVE", the application will prompt the operative to answer a few questions.</p>
        <p>If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> selects "No", the application will go to the "SIGN" screen where the signatures captured will be listed. However, if the operative selects "Yes" then the application will display the </p>
        <p>"Survey" for the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> to complete.</p>
