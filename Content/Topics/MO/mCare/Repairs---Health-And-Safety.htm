        <p>If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> has not passed the "Health And Safety" form, they will be alerted that they have failed the Heath and safety survey and will not be able to proceed. </p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> can either tap "Yes" which will close the task from the device or the operative can select "No" which will allow them to return to the survey to amend any details that may have been entered incorrectly.</p>
