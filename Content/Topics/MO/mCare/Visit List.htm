        <p>Tapping on "Visit List" from the main menu will take the user to the Visit List screen</p>

        </p>
        <p>If configured to do so in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> can view future visits by swiping left or tapping onto the day of the week that they wish to view.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Tapping on the search icon located in the top right corner of the "Visit List" screen will show the search features. Here the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> can do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search via keywords. This can be both number and letters</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> can also  "GROUP BY" the following filtering option:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>None</li>
            <li>Plot</li>
            <li>Development</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <img src="../../../Resources/Images_M-O/MO/mCare/Visit List Group By.PNG" style="width: 158px;height: 270px;" /></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>All Visits will have the status 'NEW' if they have not yet been started. For visits that have already been started and not yet submitted then they will have the status 'STARTED' against them on the 'Visit List' screen.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_M-O/MO/mCare/Visit Status.PNG" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p> The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> can start multiple visits and complete them at a later stage during their log-in session. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> logs out without submitting any task data, the app will buffer the data onto the device allowing the user to submit the data in a later log-in session. Clearing scripts will remove all buffered data from the device.</p>
