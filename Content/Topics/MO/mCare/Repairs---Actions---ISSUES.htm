            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Repairs - Actions - ISSUES</h1>
        <p>From the "Actions" screen the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will first see the Issues tab, they can also swipe across to the "NOTES", "SIGN" and "COMPLETE" screens.</p>
        <p>The hamburger menu will always be displayed in the top-left corner of the screen, this will give the user the ability to navigate their way to alternative screens.</p>
        <p>

        <p>From the above example there are 3 issues. The issue with the reference number 120 is the issue that came from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, the two additional issues were added from the device during the visit.</p>
        <p>We can see the 3 different <MadCap:variable name="Variables.colours" /> (blue, grey and green).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blue - issues that have not been given a "Complete" or "Incomplete" status. The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will not be able to complete the visit without a status being selected.</li>
            <li>Grey - Incomplete</li>
            <li>Green - Complete </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Tapping on the issue that came from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will display the issue details. This screen will contain the following information regarding the issue:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Issue reference number</li>
            <li>Call reference number</li>
            <li>Description </li>
            <li>Location</li>
            <li>Sub-Location</li>
            <li>Category </li>
            <li>Sub-Category </li>
            <li>Priority </li>
            <li>Notes </li>
            <li>Photos captured from previous visit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_M-O/MO/mCare/Issue details 2.PNG" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will also be able to capture photo's against the issue in a similar fashion to inspections.</p>
        <p>Tapping on the green add issue button will load the "Add Issue" screen. Similar to adding an issue from an inspection when failing an item, the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will need to enter the following details:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Description </li>
            <li>Location</li>
            <li>Category </li>
            <li>Priority </li>
            <li>Notes </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> can also add photos against the issue, save or discard the issue.</p>
        <p>Tapping on the back or the cancel ("X") button will display the following message, where they need to confirm their action before proceeding.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_M-O/MO/mCare/unsaved issues.PNG" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>If the issue is added it will appear on the "Actions" screen where the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.operative" /> will have the option to delete it. </p>
        <p>The user can continue to add additional issues.</p>
