            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />mSite</h1>
        <p>mSite allows site managers to quickly and easily update the construction stages of multiple plots, saving time and effort and providing real time information to managers back at head office.</p>
        <p>By using a mobile application on a smartphone or tablet, you can link your construction site managers directly to the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> back-end System.</p>
        <p>Make it easy for busy site managers to keep plot status information accurate and up-to-date. Its easy to use interface is ideal for use by field based construction staff without the need for in-depth IT training.</p>
        <p>Easily upload relevant information in a variety of formats - site information including photos, images and notes can be attached to each construction stage of each plot.</p>
        <p>Implementing mSite significantly improves efficiency which reduces overheads and can improve competitiveness. Positive results for your management team – and your customers.</p>
        <p>mSite gives you complete visibility of your plot progress as well as more efficiency on-site and reduced administration overheads at head office. Site managers and office-based commercial managers can focus on their core role rather than dealing with paperwork or re-keying information.</p>
