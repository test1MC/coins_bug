            <MadCap:concept term="COINS Mobile" />mFM Overview</h1>
        <p>Managing field engineers through paper-based work instructions can be a challenge. Whether you’re looking to increase visibility and productivity of your mobile workforce, improve the integrity of your field-sourced data or just give your customers a better experience, mFM removes paper from the process making your business more efficient whilst reducing costs.</p>
        <p>By using a mobile application on a device such as a smartphone or tablet, you can link field engineers to your back-end planning system. This allows them to pick-up new jobs and complete and store job data on the device in real-time - even in areas without a mobile signal.</p>
