        <p>Once the user arrives at the location for the task, they may not be able to access it. Therefore they will need to tap the button No Access. </p>

        </p>
        <p> There is also an option to enter Notes for any observations.</p>
        <p>Once the user has filled in as much information as possible and clicks continue, the user will be prompted to confirm the reason. They can select alternative reasons or confirm their previous selection by clicking on the drop down menu.</p>
