        <h2><a name="_Toc514669221"></a>GL Forecasting Phase II (25251)</h2>
        <p>GL Account Forecasting functionality, which was developed in version 11.08, has been enhanced with new features.</p>
        <h2><a name="_Toc514669209"></a>General Ledger Reporter Improvements (25273)</h2>
        <p>The Configurable GL Reporter has been changed to improve the search, and the add and update options.</p>
        <h2><a name="_Toc514669210"></a>CS Certificate Import via Workspace (25279)</h2>
        <p>A new approach to loading <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales caps" /> certificates has been provided. This involves importing a flat file into a workspace, where the data can be validated, and with options to make amendments, clear the workspace or load the data into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. <i>See </i><a href="https://www.coins-global.com/storage/documents/OA-CE-CS003-ImportCerts-[%=Variables.uk-usa%].pdf" target="_blank" style="font-style: italic;">OA-CE-CS003</a><i> for details.</i></p>
        <h2><a name="_Toc514669211"></a>CB Quick Cash Listing Reports (24635)</h2>
        <p>Listing reports including a GL summary are now produced for quick cash receipt and payment batches.</p>
        <h2><a name="_Toc514669212"></a>Enter Cash Receipts by Invoice Number (25207)</h2>
        <p>It is now possible to enter cash receipts and apply the cash by invoice number or certificate reference if you do not know the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.sl customer" /> or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />. You can also now enter multiple receipts against a single invoice or certificate in one batch.</p>
        <h2><a name="_Toc514669213"></a>Quick Cash Receipt and Unallocated Cash Enhancements (25030)</h2>
        <p>Changes have been made to allow you to quickly enter cash receipts and allocate small variances to adjustment accounts without having to create credit invoices, and to ensure that unallocated cash is left in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cash Book caps" /> rather than in the source ledger. <i>See </i><a href="https://www.coins-global.com/storage/documents/OA-CE-CB012-QuickCashEnhancements-[%=Variables.uk-usa%].pdf" target="_blank" style="font-style: italic;">OA-CE-CB012</a><i> for details.</i></p>
