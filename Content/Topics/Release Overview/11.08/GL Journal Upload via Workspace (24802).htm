        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 ">GL Journal Upload via Workspace (24802)</h1>
        <p>A new approach to loading General Ledger journals has been provided. This involves importing a CSV file into a workspace, where the data can be validated, and with options to make amendments, clear the workspace or load the data into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. This resolves issues with using Bulk Add which is limited by the number of records that can be loaded.
See <a href="https://www.coins-global.com/storage/documents/OA-CE-GL004-JournalUploadWorkspace-UK.pdf" target="_blank">OA-CE-GL004</a> for details.</p>
