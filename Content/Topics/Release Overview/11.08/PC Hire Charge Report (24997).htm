        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 "><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Pc Hire caps" /> Charge Calculate Report (24997)</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Pc Hire caps" /> Charge Calculate report has been re-written as a standard OA report. This stores more detail of the workings, which are made available to the invoice print. A new option allows you to email the report output to site, so they can be given visibility of coming charges. In addition, functionality has been added to allow users to reset (cancel) charges (using a new action on the Charges batch screen).
