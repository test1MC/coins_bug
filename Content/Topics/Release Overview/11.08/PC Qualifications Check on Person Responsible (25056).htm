        <p>It is now possible to check that if the person responsible for an asset is an operator (based on their job type), they are qualified to operate it. If the planned responsibility is far enough in the future that the operator could get training, a warning only is displayed. A report highlights any shortfall in qualifications. See <a href="https://www.coins-global.com/storage/documents/OA-CE-PC008-PersRespQualCheck-UK.pdf" target="_blank">OA-CE-PC008</a> for details. </p>
