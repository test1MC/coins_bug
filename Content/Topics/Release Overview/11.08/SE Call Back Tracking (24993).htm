        <p>The ability to track call backs has been added to Service Management. A call back means that a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.se technician" /> will need to return to a Location when the work performed on the original Service Order does not resolve the issue. Call back percentages can serve as a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.se technician" /> training metric.</p>
