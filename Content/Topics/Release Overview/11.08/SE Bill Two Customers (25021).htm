        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 ">Bill Two Customers (25021)</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA Service Management module now gives users the ability to bill two customers from a single <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Order caps" />. This includes being able to collect an on-site payment from the customer who owns that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Se Service Order caps" />. For example, residential customers with a home warranty require the homeowner to pay a deductible, with the balance billed to the home warranty company.
