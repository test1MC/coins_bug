            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" /><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Bq Bill of Quantities caps" /> Process</h1>
        <p>The process of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill of quantities" /> in its entirety starts from configuring the module. Once the configuration of the module is done <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Bq Bill of Quantities caps" /> can then be used.</p>
        <p class="note">Before exploring <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Bq Bill of Quantities caps" />, a Project/<MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" />/Development needs to be created, <b>this is done outside of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq boq" /> module</b>.</p>
        <p>A Project is created in Procurement which then makes it possible to create a contract in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Status module. Once a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> is created a Development can be created based on this <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />.</p>
        <p>Developments can be created in VAP or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq boq" /> as both are one and the same but displayed in both modules.</p>
        <p>Though the logical next step would be to create plots on the development, it requires house types to initially be configured, this is not to say that a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> needs to be created but a high level house type name needs to be created, this is done within <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq boq" /> &gt; Setup.</p>
        <p>An example of a house type is provided below:</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="BOQ Images/Bill of Quantities Process_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Once a house type is created you can then associate this with plots created against the development.</p>
        <img src="BOQ Images/Bill of Quantities Process_1.png" class="FullWidth" MadCap:conditions="COINS.Pre-v1105" />
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="BOQ Images/Bill of Quantities Process_1_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When you have a development and associated plots (with house type association) you are then able to start using <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Bq Bill of Quantities caps" /> to build your bill based on house types.</p>
        <p>You can create standard house type bills within the standard house type workbench and then filter this down to a development level, making the house type bill accessible to the individual development.</p>
        <p>At this stage you have already created the standard bill, copied it down to the development and are ready to associate it with house types of the same type at plot level, this is simply done in one easy process which makes the development items available to each plot that has the same house type.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #ff4500;">It is worth noting that bill of quantities is formed around house types as this defines what resources are needed on each plot.

        <p>Once at Plot level you are then able to start ordering items, this can be done in either the surveyor workbench or the buyer workbench, both have the same function however the buyer workbench is reduced as the simplest form of ordering material or subcontract.</p>
