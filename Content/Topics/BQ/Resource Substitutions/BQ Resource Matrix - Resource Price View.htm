            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />BQ Resource Matrix - Resource Price View</h1>
        <p style="page-break-after: avoid;">A new Resource Price view of the Resource Matrix in the <span class="function">Development House Type Workbench</span> and the <span class="function">Surveyors Plot Workbench</span> gives an efficient way to update prices for resources across all house types (or plots). This is particularly appropriate for subcontract prices which are specific to each house type.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/BQ/Resource Matrix Screens/Resource Matrix Price View.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Each cell displays one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="text-align: left;">“No Items” if the resource does not occur in the development house type <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" />  (or the plot <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" />). </li>
            <li style="text-align: left;">The price if the resource does occur in the development house type <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> (or the plot <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" />). You can update these cells with a price. A tooltip shows the price units, quantity, unit, and value.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Actions</h2>
        <p>The following actions are available on the right-click cell and row menus.</p>
        <ul class="CompactList">
            <li>Nominate Supplier</li>
            <li>Apply Prices</li>
            <li>Set as "Ready to Use"</li>
            <li>Set as "Not Ready to Use"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are the same actions as on the other views of the Resource matrix. The standard Copy and Paste actions are also available on the cell menu.</p>
