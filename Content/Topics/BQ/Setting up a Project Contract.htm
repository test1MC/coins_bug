            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Setting up a Project, Contract and Development Projects</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="Body">Setting up Projects is done within the procurement module: <span class="Function">Procurement &gt; <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Mk Projects caps" /></span></p>
        <img src="BOQ Images/Setting up a Project Contract_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        <p class="Body">Within this workbench you are then able to create projects, this is needed before creating any contract or development.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Adding Projects</h2>
        <p class="Body">To add a project, click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Add_Both.flsnp" />.</p>
        <p class="Body">Once you click on the add button you are presented with a new screen. </p>
        <p class="Body">&#160;</p>
        <img src="BOQ Images/Setting up a Project Contract_B_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        <p class="Body">This screen consists of a number of tabs Any coloured field denotes it being mandatory.</p>
        <p class="Body">Within a project only two fields are mandatory, Name and Location.</p>
        <p class="Body">Everything else can be filled out at a later stage but for the purpose of the project being informative we recommend that the contract details tab is filled out correctly as this contains information on the commencement dates and expected completion dates.</p>
        <p class="Body">Set the Type drop-down to the appropriate option and then complete the Main Tab details.</p>
        <p class="Body">Once you are happy with the information the page should look similar to the example below.</p>
        <img src="BOQ Images/Setting up a Project Contract_3_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        <p class="Body">&#160;</p>
        <p>Click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Save_Both.flsnp" />. Once this is saved you are then able to add this project as a contract.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Contracts</h2>
        <p class="Body">Contracts are based on created projects, the idea behind this is that a project can be in negotiations before ever becoming a firm contract.</p>
        <p class="Body">Contracts are created and maintained within the contract status module, when navigating to the module there is a function in the menu labelled ‘contracts’, clicking on this will show you all contracts currently in the system.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">The project that you have just created does not automatically appear, it must be created manually. If the project does not exist a contract or development cannot be created.</p>
