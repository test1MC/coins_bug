        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p class="Body">The Surveyor and Buyer workbench work in exactly the same way, the only difference between the two workbenches is that the buyers workbench is a cut down version of the surveyors, focusing primarily on buying, an example of both is included below;</p>
        <h2>Buyers</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench.png" style="height: 72px; width: 476px;" class="FullWidth" />
        <h2>Surveyors</h2>
        <p class="Body_1">
            <img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_1.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">In the following explanation we will primarily be covering the Surveyor workbench as the fundamentals are exactly the same as Buyers.</p>
        <p class="Body">To Start, the <span class="Heading4Char">Matrix Views </span>replicate what is available in the development house type workbench, it allows you to apply changes to the matrix items and add <span class="Heading4Char">variant</span><span class="Heading4Char">s</span> to plots where applicable by the Variant Matrix View.</p>
        <h2>Matrix Views</h2>
        <p class="Body">The Matrix Views Tab allows you to see the resources in numerous ways, it also allows you to interact with the resources on different levels, this can be done by payment stage, variants matrix, Estimating Sections and resources.</p>
        <p class="Body_1">
            <img src="BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_28.png" style="height: 166px; width: 602px;" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">on the <span class="Heading4Char">Payment Stage Matrix</span>, you have the ability to apply actions to rows or elements, this allows you to update individual items or a whole line per payment stage.</p>
        <p class="Body">This is done with the following actions, clicking on the arrow actions the row or element action.</p>
        <p class="Body">Row;Element;</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_29.png" style="height: 112px; width: 193px;" class="HalfWidth" />
            <img src="BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_30.png" style="height: 112px; width: 199px;" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="span_4">Apply Price</span> – applies any new price to a row or element where applicable</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="span_4">Print <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq boq" /></span> – gives you the ability to print the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /></p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="span_4">Update VAP Budget</span> – Updates the VAP budget based on the entries on this screen</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="span_4">Set as Ready to Use</span> – sets the item as ready to procure</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="span_4">Add <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cost Head caps" /></span>- adds the cost head to the house type when it is set to N/A</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="span_4">Set Stage as Required/Set Stage as not required </span><span class="span_4">– </span>Makes item unavailable to use</p>
        <h2>Summary Views</h2>
        <p class="Body">The Summary views emulate the matrix views, this functionality allows you to give read only access to users, enabling them to see the matrix views but only able to filter, sort and find information on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" />.</p>
        <h2>Material, Subcontract and Plant Tabs</h2>
        <p class="Body">The Material, Subcontract and Plant tabs are exactly the same, they handle ordering but for each category, i.e materials and subcontracts. It is worth noting that the plant tab is not generally used, and that plant ordering is usually directed through the standard procurement process.</p>
        <p class="Body">As you can see below, the material and subcontract menus exist in the exact same structure, therefore this how to guide will only cover Materials.</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_2.png" class="HalfWidth" /> <img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_3.png" class="HalfWidth" /></p>
        <p class="Body">there are numerous ways in which you are able to order through both workbenches, you can order through each package and variation matrix, through the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> items directly or through the package browse, all require <span class="span_6">nominating a supplier</span> and <span class="span_6">applying a price</span>, ensuring that <span class="span_6">the item is set to ready</span> to use.</p>
        <p class="Body">The Package Matrix view and the Variation Matrix view look exactly the same, you are able to order items via package, or by variation (where applicable)</p>
        <p class="Body">The element and row both contain the same value actions, </p>
        <p class="Body">Seq Action, Nominate Supplier, Apply Prices, Set as ‘Ready to use’, Add to Item Basket and finally add to item basket (Bulk)</p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_4.png" style="height: 157px; width: 285px;" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Seq Action</span> allows you to specify more than one action, in general terms you are able to sequence a number of actions to run sequentially.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Nominating a supplier</span> is essential to ensuring you are able to order a resource, and must be selected when trying to order.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Applying Prices</span> allows you to apply any price changes that may have been made at standard house type, development house type or price workbench, this gives you full control over which items require the price increase and which are applicable.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Set as Ready to Use</span> allows you to order an item, if this is not set then the item cannot be ordered, the system will alert you in several ways if you are not able to order the item.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Add to Item Basket, add to Item Basket (Bulk)</span> allows you to add numerous items to the basket, ‘add to item basket’ allows you to add singular items to the basket, ‘add to item basket bulk’ allows you to order bulk items where specified (on the resource record) – <span class="span_5">NOTE: this also affects how it displays on the order form, Bulk items tend to group together as one order line.</span></p>
        <p class="Body">There are two main ways of viewing the matrix, by value and by status, this is controlled by the filter located at the bottom of the page.</p>
        <h2>Package Value View</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_5.png" class="FullWidth" />
        <h2>Package Status View</h2>
        <img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_6.png" style="height: 317px; width: 530px;" class="FullWidth" />
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Package status view allows you to see items from a procurement perspective, this allows you to easily see if an item has been order or is in the process of being ordered. This view is available across all matrix views in the ordering process.</p>
        <p class="Body">&#160;</p>
        <p class="Body">When hovering over an item you are presented with information on how far along in the procurement process the item is.</p>
        <p class="Body">&#160;</p>
        <img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_7.png" class="FullWidth" />
        <p class="Body">you are then able to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> an individual element and make it ready to order, then add the item to your basket, as seen in screenshot below.</p>
        <p class="Body">&#160;</p>
        <img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_8.png" style="height: 333px; width: 490px;" class="FullWidth" /> <p class="Body">once you click the arrow next to the ‘add to item basket’ the screen will refresh, this means that the item has been added to the item basket, you are then able to navigate to the item basket.</p><h2>Item Basket &amp; Ordering</h2><p class="Body">The Item basket can be navigated to by going to ‘My Item Basket’ in the drop down under each of the tabs (Material or Subcontract)</p><p class="Body"><img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_9.png" style="height: 256px; width: 207px;" class="HalfWidth" /></p><p class="Body">Once in ‘My Item Basket’ you are able to select the specific items that you are wanting to order, these are displayed as ‘new orders’ under the reason column.</p><p class="Body">&#160;</p><img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_10.png" class="FullWidth" /><p class="Body">if you select the items that you are wanting and ensure that the actions bar has ‘Create Orders from Selected Items’ you can then click the arrow to proceed and create the order.</p><p class="Body">&#160;</p><img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_11.png" class="FullWidth" /><p class="Body">On clicking the arrow, you are presented with a standard procurement screen where you can select the order type, date, description and a number of subsequent fields that are specific to the order;</p><p class="Body">&#160;</p><img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_12.png" class="FullWidth" /><p class="Body">by clicking next, the system will create the order and subsequently remove the items from your item basket as seen below;</p><img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_13.png" class="FullWidth" /><p class="Body">once removed from the item basket you can view and commit the order from the ‘Orders Raised’ option under the menu structure of the category that you are working with.</p><p class="Body"><img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_14.png" style="height: 216px; width: 163px;" class="HalfWidth" /></p><p>&#160;</p><img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_15.png" style="height: 261px; width: 603px;" class="FullWidth" /><p class="Body_8">from here you are then able to select the order, commit, print, draft print, create cancellation and more using the action bar towards the bottom of the page. It’s worth noting that if you are confident the order is correct and you are wanting to commit, printing the order would auto commit it too.</p><p class="Body"><img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_16.png" style="height: 175px; width: 276px;" class="HalfWidth" /></p><h2>Ordering from Package Browse</h2><p class="Body">You are able to also order from the package browse screen; this is handy when the package contains all of the resources within the package, by navigating to the package browse screen you have the ability to select a number of alternative ways to add items.</p><p class="Body">&#160;</p><p class="Body"><img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_17.png" style="height: 241px; width: 200px;" class="HalfWidth" /></p><p class="Body">It is worth noting that the package browse also shows you the status of ordering and if items are priced, the value and number of items associated to the package.</p><p class="Body">&#160;</p><img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_18.png" style="height: 144px; width: 601px;" class="FullWidth" /><p class="Body">The actions available on the menu are listed below; these allow you to order items in a number of ways including variations, reorder, appending items, setting items as ready to use or not ready. All items work in the exact same way as the standard ordering method</p><p class="Body"><img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_19.png" style="height: 175px; width: 178px;" class="HalfWidth" /></p><p class="Body">&#160;</p><h2><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Bq Bill caps" /> Items</h2><p class="Body"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Bq Bill caps" /> Items exist in the same menu, this item allows you to order directly from the list of items on the development and on the plot. You are able to add last-minute changes to a plot in this menu using the add type selector set to ‘resource line’. The selectors for adding to basket exist on the line also.</p><p class="Body_7">NOTE: you are not able to order items if a supplier and price has not been defined, the system will error advising you to nominate a supplier</p><p class="Body_1"><img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_20.png" style="height: 187px; width: 602px;" class="FullWidth" /></p><h2>Supplementary Items</h2><p class="p_3">Within the same menu drop down in each of the categories you have a number of other items that may be useful, it includes the following;</p><p class="p_3"><span class="Heading4Char">Orders requiring Variation</span> shows you any orders that may have had quantity changes or price changes that need a variation raised.</p><p class="p_3"><span class="Heading4Char">Create Orders from Item basket</span> allows you to create orders from all items in your order basket, this means you do not need to select individual lines. The system will automatically raise orders based on the supplier and order details (bulk vs singular)</p><p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">My New Orders</span> show you orders that have recently been raised and not committed, this allows you to easily navigate and commit the orders that need to go to the supplier. </p><p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Clear My Orders</span> allow you to clear any orders that exist in the ‘my new orders’ screen, allowing you to easily maintain the list.</p><h2>Development Items</h2><p class="Body">Just like the House type items workbenches, the development items within the surveyors’ workbench allow you to add, delete and modify resources, it automatically adds in the information to the payment stages tab and where applicable the intelligent resources.</p><p class="Body">To Add a resource, ensure that the ‘add type’ on the workbench is set to ‘Resource Line’</p><p class="Body">&#160;</p><img src="BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_5.png" style="height: 60px; width: 563px;" class="FullWidth" /><p class="Body">if you now click on ADD, you’ll be taken to a screen where you’ll be able to add a new resource.</p><p class="Body">There are 4 main parts to the adding of a resource to the house type item tab. These are ‘Item Selection’, ‘Pricing Details’, ‘Other Details’ and ‘Ordering Details’, an example of what could be input is below;</p><h2>Item Selection</h2><p>&#160;</p><img src="BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_6.png" style="height: 201px; width: 602px;" class="FullWidth" /><p class="Body">it is worth noting that within the <span class="Heading4Char">Pricing Details</span> you <span class="span_4">MUST</span> ensure that the ‘status’ is set to ‘Not Applicable’ against the categories that aren’t being used and also ensure that the ‘item ready to use’ <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> box is not ticked.</p><p class="Body">&#160;</p><img src="BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_7.png" style="height: 159px; width: 602px;" class="FullWidth" /><p class="Body">Other Details is more memo data rather than specifically affecting anything to do with the resource and useage of it.</p><p class="Body">&#160;</p><img src="BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_8.png" style="height: 82px; width: 601px;" class="FullWidth" /><p class="Body">It is important to ensure that the <span class="Heading4Char">ordering details</span> are filled out and that a resource is associated to either a material or subcontract package.</p><p class="Body">&#160;</p><img src="BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_9.png" class="FullWidth" /><p class="Body">once you are happy with your resource you can click ‘SAVE’, once it is saved, the screen will blank out all of the details you have just entered, this is so that you can add a new resource without navigating away. To navigate away from this click ‘UNDO’ at the bottom right hand side of the screen. You will eventually have a screen that looks like this;</p><p class="Body">&#160;</p><img src="BOQ Images/Standard House type Workbench_1_10.png" style="height: 243px; width: 603px;" class="FullWidth" /><p class="Body">This, unlike the development items on house types, allows you to add per plot as this level is specific to plot.</p><h2>More Tab</h2><p class="Body">Under the More tab you have numerous options, some of which we have already explored,</p><p class="Body"><img src="BOQ Images/Surveyors Plots Buyers Workbench_21.png" class="HalfWidth" /></p><p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Apply House Type Changes to Plots</span> – applies any changes that exist at house type level to the individual plots, in essence this copies each of the resources for each plot.</p><p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Plot <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq boq" /> Rebuild from House Types</span> – this allows you to rebuild the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> from a house type if there are many changes that have happened at house type level that need a complete rebuild</p><p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Apply Prices to Plot</span> – Applying prices to plots exists for the sole reason of prices that may have been changed on the prices workbench.</p><p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Update VAP Budget</span> – updates the VAP budget based on items within the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" />, this is useful for updating site start and current forecast.</p><p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Resource Substitution</span> – allows you to substitute resources that have been labelled as substitute, this allows you to easily swap out bricks that may be of different <MadCap:variable name="Variables.colour" /> or variance of some sort.</p><p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Package Setup Browse</span> – allows you to see packages that have been set up, though this is set up in procurement you are able to see this against the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> also.</p><p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Bq Bill caps" /> Stage Summary Report</span> – a report to show you the stage of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> in summary format, this report can be used as part of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR" /> pack if this level of detail is needed.</p><p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Plot <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Bq Bill caps" /> Print</span> <span class="Heading4Char">Report</span> – an easy way to print out the entire <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> based on plot.</p><p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Package Status Report</span> – this report shows you the packages that are currently available against the development and provides details of the status in terms of what has / needs to be ordered.</p><p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Procurement Plan</span> – procurement plans can be set up to allow you to order, other than bulk, you are able to then schedule the ordering for when it is needed for each phase of the development.</p></body>
