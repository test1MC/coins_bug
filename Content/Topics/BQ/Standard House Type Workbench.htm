        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">General Overview</h2>
        <p>When initially clicking on the standard house type workbench you are presented with all the standard house types that exist on the system, from a high level you are able to see the house type code, the name, market mix and a description, all customised through the standard house type function within setup.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">Clicking on one of the house types opens up all the options you are able to apply against the house type in question.</p>
        <p class="Body">The standard house type workbench displays resources but in different ways. Firstly, you have <span class="Heading4Char">Payment S</span><span class="Heading4Char">tages tab</span>, which displays the resources by the associated cost head and payment stage.</p>

        </p>
        <p><span class="Heading4Char">Estimating Sections</span><span class="Heading4Char"> Tab</span> displays all associated resources by the estimated section set up against the resource. It is worth noting that because only one estimating section exists (‘STD’) this tab becomes slightly less useful as there is no obvious split.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Package Browse</span> allows you to browse resources by the package associated with them, this gives you a good outlook of what is being spent on each package, examples such as Lintels, or Plumbing can easily be seen.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">House Type Items</span> shows you all resources by resource code, although you are also able to sort by payment stage, description, quantity, price and variants.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Heading4Char">Variants</span> display any variants that have been associated with this standard house type, it’s worth noting that the variants do not have to be associated at this stage and can be associated at development level. </p>

        <p class="Body"> An intelligent resource is a composite of two or more resources, which can be added to a BOQ in a single action.&#160; For example, an intelligent resource could be created to represent all the components per square metre of a cavity wall, including bricks, blocks, mortar, wall ties, labour, etc.&#160; The user could then add a number of square metres of cavity wall to the BOQ, which will then calculate the quantity of each resource to be included. </p>
        <p class="note">If no intelligent resources are being used this workbench will be blank.</p>
