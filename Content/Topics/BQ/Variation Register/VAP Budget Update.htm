            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Variations and VAP Budget Update</h1>
        <p>When running <span class="Function">Update VAP&#160;Budget</span> from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill of quantities" style="text-transform: capitalize;" />, detailed items linked to live variations will always be included.</p>
        <p>If <span class="Field">Update VAP&#160;Budget with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Bq Bill caps" /> Items</span> is <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed on the status of the variation and at least one <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> item is linked to the variation, the revised <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> items will be included in the budget update.</p>
        <p>The budget can also include an allowance for variations which have not been approved, or which have been approved but for which the detailed <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> items have not yet been input. The allowance is included on the budget against a fixed payment stage/plot combination, which is specified on the variation reason code (see <MadCap:xref href="Variation Reason Codes.htm">1 , Variation Reason Codes</MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <p>This creates an allowance based on the variation’s approved cost for the value of such items in the budget and thus in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVR" />.  The status at which the approved costs get included in the VAP Budget is determined by the <span class="Field">Update VAP Budget with Approved Cost</span> option on the associated status code.</p>
