            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Linking <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Bq Bill caps" /> Items to Variations</h1>
        <p>When you update items and create orders for subcontract and materials within the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill of quantities" />, you can optionally link these to the variation register. You can link as many plot <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> items as required to the same variation header, but each plot <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> item can only be linked to one ‘in progress’ variation header at once.</p>
        <p>A new field has been added to the <span class="Function">Plot <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Bq Bill caps" /> Item Maintenance</span> screen.</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown class="screenshot">
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Plot <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Bq Bill caps" /> Item Maintenance</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>

                    <p>This is a drop-down list that allows you to select the variation to link the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> item to. The list only includes variations that have a system status of Registered, Budget Approval or Budget Approved, and if the variations are plot-specific (that is, if they have a reason code with a system status of Client Extra, Client Incentive or Client Option), they will only be included for the plot they relate to.</p>
                    <p>If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> item is already associated with a variation and the system status is Detail Approval or Detail Approved, the variation cannot be changed. </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>If you amend an ordered item, it will be flagged as requiring a variation.  The variation order will not be able to be processed until the variation has been made live.</p>
        <h2>Item Delete</h2>
        <p>A new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> item row action ‘Variation Delete Item’ has been added to all plot <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> item browses.  On selecting this you are prompted to select a variation to link the deleted item to.  The list only includes variations that have a system status of Registered, Budget Approval or Budget Approved, and if the variations are plot-specific (that is, if they have a reason code with a system status of Client Extra, Client Incentive or Client Option), they will only be included for the plot they relate to.</p>
        <p>If the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> item is already associated with a variation whose system status is Detail Approval or Detail Approved, the variation cannot be changed and the row action is prevented.</p>
        <p>You can still delete plot <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> items directly where required and do not have to link all deletes to a variation.</p>
        <h2>Item Indicator Column</h2>
        <p>On <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> item browses, the last column is an indicator which has now been changed to indicate if the item is part of a variation. So the possible codes are now:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>C - The plot item has been overwritten from the associated house type <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> item.</li>
            <li>VA - The item has been added as part of a variation and the variation is not yet live.</li>
            <li>VU - The item has been updated as part of a variation and the variation is not yet live.</li>
        </ul>
