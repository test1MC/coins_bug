        <p>An OA workflow can be launched to approve a variation. Specify the workflow code on the status code setup (see <MadCap:xref href="Variation Status Codes.htm">1 , Variation Status Codes</MadCap:xref>).  When the variation moves to a status linked to a workflow, the OA workflow will be launched.</p>
