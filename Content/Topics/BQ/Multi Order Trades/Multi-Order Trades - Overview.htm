        <p class="Body">Multi-order trades functionality cross validates to ensure that where multiple subcontractors have been given orders for the same items of work, each stage of work on each plot is only paid for once (although the total payment can be split between subcontractors).  This is designed to handle situations where there are several subcontractors of the same trade on a development and the work is allocated to each on an ongoing basis but the prices for each stage on each plot are agreed in advance.</p>
        <p class="Body">It is <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">now </MadCap:conditionalText>possible to generate subcontract orders and subcontracts for multi-order trades from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Bq Bill of Quantities caps" />. The user can nominate multiple subcontractors for the same <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> items and then generate orders for each of the nominated subcontractors.</p>
