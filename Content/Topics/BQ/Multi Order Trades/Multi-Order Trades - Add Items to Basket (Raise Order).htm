        <p class="Body">All functions that add items to the basket or directly raise orders from subcontract items have been amended to add each of the items for each of the package subcontractors. Package subcontractors that have been set as retired are not included.</p>
        <p class="Body">The <span class="Function">Add Variation</span>, <span class="Function">Append Items</span>, <span class="Function">Raise Variation</span>, and <span class="Function">Raise Addendum</span> functions have been similarly updated.</p>
        <p class="Body">The <span class="Function">Add Reorder to Item Basket</span> and <span class="Function">Raise Reorder</span> functions raise orders for each of the package subcontractors for which there is not already a subcontract order for the development.  This allows new subcontractors to be added part way through the development.</p>
