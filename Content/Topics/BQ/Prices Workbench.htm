        <p class="Body">The pricing workbench consists of five tabs : General Prices, Supplier Prices, All Prices and By Supplier and Options.</p>
        <p class="Body">The first four all show the same type of information, the only difference is a pre determined filter exists on each tab.</p>
        <p class="Body">&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Emphasis">General Prices</span> – this shows any resource and price that is not specific against a supplier</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Emphasis">Supplier Prices </span>– This shows resources that specifically have suppliers related to it</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Emphasis">All Prices</span> – Regardless of it being a general or supplier price it is shown in this tab</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="Emphasis">By Supplier </span>– Shows Supplier Prices but rather than listing by resource this is listed by supplier, this makes it easier to upload a number of resources related to this supplier by bulk.</p>
        <p class="Body">The <span class="Emphasis">Options</span> menu lets you apply any price changes to standard or development house types, this allows you to control prices from our workbench rather than from each house type that you create.</p>

        <p>BQ Apply Prices to Standard House Types allows you to copy any changes in standard resource prices to the corresponding resources on standard house type bills.&#160; Selection criteria allow you to choose which prices to update.</p>
        <p>BQ Apply Prices to Development House Types allows you to copy any changes in standard resource prices to the corresponding resources on site-specific house type bills.&#160; Selection criteria allow you to choose which prices to update.</p>
        <p class="Body">&#160;</p>
        <p class="Body">By clicking on either one of the options (‘apply prices to standard house types’ or ‘apply prices to development house types’) you are brought to a screen that resembles a standard <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> report.</p>
        <p class="Body">You are then able to run the ‘report’ to update prices against standard house types or development house types depending on the option you choose.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">It is worth noting that with this function you are able to run it in two modes, report only and processing. This enables you to check the update using ‘report only’ to ensure that the updates are going to be correct before actually applying them, this applies to both options under this menu.</p>
