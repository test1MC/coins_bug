            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Standard Variant Setup</h1>
        <p>Standard variants cater for potential variations to the standard specification for a <a href="../WD/WDVP0001_Standard_House_Types.html">standard</a> or <a href="../WD/WDVP0002_Development-Specific_House_Types.html"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.vp site"></MadCap:variable> house type</a>. Examples include: a change of elevational treatment from all brick to half rendered; a change of roof from gable to hipped; a change of internal specification from open market to social housing, a change of all ironmongery to luxury quality, etc. </p>
        <p>Variants allow you to maintain a single <MadCap:variable name="Variables.bq bill" /> for a house type containing the possible variations, rather than have to setup multiple house types.</p>
        <p>You can specify which variants should not be used together on the same plot.&#160; For example, a plot might have standard or deluxe sanitary ware, but not both. </p>
        <p>You specify which variants are relevant to each house type, then for each variant, you build up a list of items that are added to or omitted from the house type if that variant is used.</p>
