            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Marking Standing Journals as Ready to Post</h1>
        <p>You will only be able to set the standing journal as ready to post if there are no errors associated with it.  </p>
        <p><b>If errors are present the field will have a red background.</b>
        </p>
        <p>You will be prevented from setting this flag if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are no detail lines</li>
            <li>The batch isn't balanced</li>
            <li>The next period date is outside the active period</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">If there is a warning associated with the standing journal then the field background will be amber.  </p>
        <p>The reason for this would be one or more of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are detail lines but they are all zero.</li>
            <li>The standard journal batch has been amended with values and/or new lines for the current posting only.</li>
            <li>The next period is not the current GL period.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The reason for the error or warning is shown on the body detail.</p>
        <p>To mark selected journals as ready to post, select the line/s and Use the Choose Action  selector.</p>
