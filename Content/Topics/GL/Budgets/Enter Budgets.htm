        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The manual method of recording the budget information involves choosing the correct account codes and entering the details either using a budget pattern or entering the amounts individually.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Navigate to <span class="Function">General Ledger &gt; Budgets &gt; Enter Budgets</span></p>

        </p>
        <p>There are a few things to note before you continue:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have you selected the correct Budget and year?<ul><li>The Selectors section on the bottom of your screen will display the current budget and year displayed, ensure these are correct for the information you wish to update and click the Apply button</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_G-I/GL/GL-Budgets-0006-1107.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Are there existing budget amounts against the account code?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>These may already have a pattern assigned but can be changed to suit your needs</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_G-I/GL/GL-Budgets-0007-1107.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the account you want to enter the budget info on and click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Open.flsnp" /></p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_G-I/GL/GL-Budgets-0008-1107.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Before entering the budget manually the following should be checked:</p>
        <p><span class="bgamber">Budget:</span> Maintained in Budget Type.</p>
        <p><span class="bgamber">Year:</span> Maintained on the selector (advised above).</p>
        <p><span class="bgamber">Account:</span> Represents the GL account selected.</p>
        <p><span class="bgamber">Pattern:</span> The code for the budget pattern</p>
        <p><span class="bgamber">Apply pattern:</span> If this flag is set then the budget pattern will be applied to the budget totals prorating them across the individual budget periods. If it is not set then the totals are calculated from the individual budget periods. This allows you to apply a budget pattern by setting the flag and then amend these figures by unselecting the flag.</p>
        <p><span class="bgamber">Budget:</span> The forecast of your planned or expected financial position based on future income and expenditure.</p>
        <p>If a pattern has been applied <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will automatically apportion the budget figure depending on the pattern selected.</p>
        <p>This can be over ridden by entering the budget amount in ‘Budget’, unselecting ‘Pattern’ and entering the budget amount into the periods.</p>
        <p>The ‘Budget’ field acts as a control amount so will change if the amounts within the periods exceed the total entered in the ‘Budget’ field</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Quantity is not used to maintain the Budget so ignore.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>

        </p>
        <p>Once you are happy with the entry, click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Save_Both.flsnp" /></p>
