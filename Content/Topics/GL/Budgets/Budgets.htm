        <p>The General Ledger (GL) is the core of your companies’ financial records.</p>
        <p>Every transaction will flow through this ledger and provide a permanent track record of the history for all financial transactions.</p>
        <p>The GL module within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA enables you to compile Trial Balances, Income Statements, Statements of Financial Position and other required period, month and year end reports.</p>
        <p>Budgets can be recorded against each account within the GL, which you can then report on.</p>
        <p>A budget is the forecast of your planned or expected financial position based on future income and expenditure.</p>
        <p>This section will outline the two main methods of recording the data:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Manual upload</li>
            <li>Bulk upload</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There is a small amount of configuration to be made before these methods can be used.</p>
