        <p>General Ledger accounts are generated in one of two ways:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a transaction is posted to an account which has not been used before (provided the account elements within the code used in the transaction are valid and provided the parameter AUTOGEN is set to Y), <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> creates the account record automatically. In this case, you may need to use General Ledger &gt; Account Maintenance to update the account record to include any information which is not generated automatically.
</li>
            <li>Using General Ledger &gt; Account Maintenance to generate accounts manually.
</li>
        </ul>
