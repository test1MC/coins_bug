        <p>Each General Ledger account code is made up of a maximum of four elements, to reflect the structure of your general ledger.
</p>
        <p class="Example">For example, an account could consist of one 6-digit element: 019954, or of three elements such as Division, Department and Account: 01.SALES.3324. </p>
        <p>
Elements can be made up either of digits only, or of alphanumeric characters. </p>
        <p>An individual element can be up to 16 characters long, and the entire account code can have a maximum of  30 characters. The elements are separated by full-stops. </p>
        <p>

        <p>Different companies can have different account structures, but this is not recommended if you require cross-company consolidation. Note that once you have defined the structure for a given company, you cannot change it without technical assistance.</p>
        <p>Use General Ledger &gt; Setup &gt; Setup Maintenance &gt; GL Elements to set up the valid codes for each element.</p>
        <h2>Fixed elements</h2>
        <p>If your account structure has fixed elements, you must specify the combinations of elements that are valid for your accounts. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will not create accounts that do not match the list of valid fixed elements.</p>
        <p class="Example">For example, if your account structure is fixed at element 2, you must specify the valid combinations of elements 1 and 2.</p>
        <p>Use General Ledger &gt; Setup &gt; Setup Maintenance &gt; Fixed Elements to set up fixed elements.</p>
