            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />TREA and ICYA</h1>
        <p class="Body">To make two financial years available for posting at any one time and to provide a means of updating and reporting on the Retained Earnings and/or Profit and Loss (P&amp;L) for both years simultaneously without running a formal year-end process, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> uses two “system” General Ledger accounts. These are the Income Current Year Account (ICYA) and the Temporary Retained Earnings Account (TREA).</p>
        <p class="Body">The ICYA does NOT form part of the Trial Balance but is a summary account that accumulates for the current year the total movement and balance of all P&amp;L Accounts (Type “I” or “E”). This provides, for example, a very simple way of reporting on total current year P&amp;L figures in Balance Sheet reports.</p>
        <p class="Body">At each year-end, instead of clearing down P&amp;L accounts into a retained earnings account by a system-generated journal entry, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> simply starts the new year with a zero balance for all P&amp;L items.</p>
        <p class="Body">The opening TREA balance for the next year (year 2) is updated each time a P&amp;L transaction is posted to the current year (year1).</p>
        <p class="Body">In the Administration Menu of the General Ledger there is a program called “TRE Account Recalculate”. This program was written to check and rewrite the temporary retained earnings account and income current year accounts based on the current configuration.</p>
        <p class="Body">This was done by client request for the following reason:</p>
        <p class="Body">Clients had set up accounts with the wrong type (for example, a P&amp;L account was set up as a balance sheet item). Instead of having to reverse all transactions out, change the account type and re-key the transactions, this utility achieved the same result by simply changing the type and running the program.</p>
        <p class="Body">It was also found to be useful, when used with other utilities, when clients wanted to fundamentally change their ICYA and/or TREA accounts. This often caused imbalances to clients’ Trial Balances as previously “hidden” or system accounts were suddenly included.</p>
        <p class="Body">Whilst it has a place when a re-structuring exercise is being carried out as detailed above, the “TRE Account Recalculate” program should not be run without due regard to the circumstances involved. It is certainly not a “Global Fix” for whenever a Trial Balance does not balance.</p>
