        <p>GL Year End allows you to move the available General Ledger periods forward by 12 months. It does not delete any information, it only moves the 24 (or 26) open periods forward by one year. You have the option to carry budgets over to the new open year.</p>
        <p>NOTE:&#160; Once you close a year (that is, move the periods on), you can no longer post to it; you can only report on it.</p>
        <p>Navigate to General Ledger &gt; Period Processing &gt; Year End – This Company</p>
