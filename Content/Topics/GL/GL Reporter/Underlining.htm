            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Underlining</h1>
        <p>To add underlines into a report to break up the printout when showing totals and subtotals a row or single ‘-‘ or double ‘=’ lines can be printed as a separate row on the report.</p>
        <p>To achieve this effect, add the standard text lines into the report as a row, where you wish them to appear. Standard text lines allow you to insert underlining etc. into the report. In order to do this, on the report rows tab you can punctuate the report with Standard Text lines wherever you wish to underline.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_G-I/GL/GL Reporter/Underlining.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 402px;height: 302px;" />
        </p>
        <p>When you then go to the report columns tab, you then input what you would like to be displayed on a standard text line. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will then display these items at every occurrence of a Standard Text Line on the report rows.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_G-I/GL/GL Reporter/Underlining_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 442px;height: 331px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that you can use differing effects with Standard Text Lines when you use different ‘Levels’ in the report.&#160; i.e. in the example above, you could put single underlines on level 1 (and therefore ‘show on’ s1) and double underlines on level 2 (and therefore ‘show on’ s2).</p>
