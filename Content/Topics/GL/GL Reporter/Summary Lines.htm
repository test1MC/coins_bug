        <p>There are two different ways to display summary totals:</p>
        <p>Use a summary account row.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the Report Rows tab, set up a line to show the accounts you are interested in.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the Detail <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box is not ticked.</li>
            <li>Tick the Print Line <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Set up non-printing account lines and add these to a total line.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the Report Rows tab, set up a line to show the accounts you are interested in.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the Print Line <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box is not ticked.</li>
            <li>Tick the Detail <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box.</li>
            <li>In the Save Into field, enter the code for an accumulator.</li>
            <li>Set up a Total line, and enter the accumulator code in the Load From field.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In many cases both these methods will produce the same results. However, consider the following situation:</p>
        <p>Suppose you want to show the total debits and credits on a group of accounts. A summary account row would show the net total value (either positive or negative). Non-printing account lines could be configured to add debits and credits into separate accumulators, and thus show total debits and total credits.</p>
