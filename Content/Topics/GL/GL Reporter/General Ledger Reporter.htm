        <p class="Body"><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <span style="font-weight: bold;">General Ledger</span> Module has standard reports such as a Transaction Report or a Trial Balance report, but the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> General Ledger </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reporter</span> adds more value in that it enables a user to configure and customise their own reports specifically to meet their requirements. </p>
        <p class="Body">When a report is configured, balances can be retrieved for selected general ledger accounts and also for contract balances for all sectors and for a selection of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Companies. Reports can be detailed or summarised. Accounts to include in the report can be defined in the report configuration and also filtered when the report is run. Balances retrieved for accounts can be for a chosen period or year, or a year to date balance. Prior years and prior periods can also be incorporated.</p>
        <p class="Body">Typical reports that might be configured would be:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 90pt;">
            <p class="Body" style="list-style-type: disc;">Profit and loss reports</p>
            <p class="Body" style="list-style-type: disc;">Balance sheet reports</p>
            <p class="Body" style="list-style-type: disc;">Budget versus actual comparison reports</p>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">Reports are configured using the Setup submenu, and are available to be run via the Reports Report Submenu, under General Ledger Reporter.</p>
        <p class="Body">Report <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rows</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Columns</span> control the content of the report. The rows control the structure and content to be displayed, while the columns control how this information is displayed. The interaction of the defined rows and columns for the report act like a spreadsheet to process the General Ledger accounts, balances and other information.</p>
