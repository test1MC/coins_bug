        <p>The Configurable GL Enquiry allows you to set up and view accounting information which is displayed in columns across the screen and can be tailored to your own requirements. For example, you can create Balance Sheets, Trial Balances and other types of enquiries that will show figures for specified periods. The figures can be broken down further to view individual accounts and transactions in more detail.</p>
