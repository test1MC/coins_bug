        <p class="Body">When importing from a network scanner, it is now possible to create multi-page documents. A blank page is used to designate the end of one document, and the start of a new one. Each document created is in the form of a multi-page PDF.</p>
        <p class="Body">Additionally, if imported documents obtained from other sources such as email attachments consist of multi-page PDFs, these can be split into single page documents so they can be indexed separately.</p>
