            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />SHO Changes 2016</h1>
        <p>Traditionally, sales were mainly ILF/ALF, but increasingly <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> are making different kinds of sales based around a subscription model.</p>
        <p>With an ILF/ALF deal, there is a large initial capex which is the initial cost of the software and an annual <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" /> fee witch must be paid to continue using the software. In the subscription model, there is a single fee. The fee is based on what the customer would have paid in the traditional capex (ILF + ALF), plus an uplift for the cost of money, which is then spread in equal instalments over the period of the contract. This is typically a 3 to 5 year period. Unless cancelled, at the end of the contract this fee then continues until such a time as notice to cancel is received from the customer and or a new contract is negotiated.</p>
        <p>It is also common to agree payment plans, which are ILF/ALF agreements, but the cost of the deal is spread equally over a number of years and at the end of the term, the contracts revert to standard ILF/ALF arrangements.</p>
        <p>For subscriptions and Payment plans, the new SHO provides for compound interest to be calculated to allow for inflation when costs are spread over a number of years.</p>
        <p>The new SHO has been designed to cater for the new types of deals and to provide consistency in the format of the information recorded, for auditing purposes.</p>
        <p>The New SHO is divided into several key sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Header info, including customer name and address</li>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> ERP Product, by ERP Bundle or by individual component Product – used to record  the component parts of ILF or Rental</li>
            <li>Other <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Products,<ul><li>ILF/ALF or Rental basis: 	eCommerce; <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Mobile</li><li>ILF/ALF basis: 		System / data integration; User management; Web Services</li><li>Rental basis:		Managed services (including Hosting); Hardware</li></ul></li>
            <li>Third Party Products ILF &amp; ALF</li>
            <li>Professional Services</li>
            <li>Financial Summary</li>
            <li>Invoicing and special contract terms</li>
            <li>Special Licensing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>On the new SHO, boxes in green are free format entry - although some have drop-downs to assist in the completion of the form.</p>
        <p>Pink and Blue boxes will allow a degree of typing.</p>
        <p>White boxses are restricted and cannot be entered into.</p>
        <p>There is a fixed list of services that can be sold. Should you encounter a need to sell something that is not on the list, you will need to commission a new version of the SHO. You must not attemp to overwrite an existing entry in order to add any other product that is not on the SHO.</p>
        <p>Robert Brown is the SHO Document Owner</p>
