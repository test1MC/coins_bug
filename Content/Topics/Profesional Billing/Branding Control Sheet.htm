        <p>A macro button for Create List is available from this sheet which when clicked will generate the branding sheet, which is available from the Branding Product Codes tab.</p>
        <p>If for some reason a module needs to be excluded from a particular bundle the code of that module can be deleted. In that event a note should be placed to the right of the relevant row in the table indicating that a module has been excluded and the reason why.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">People should be aware that there are dependencies between some modules i.e. one will not work without another. If in doubt Tim Armitage should be contacted before removing a module from the branding control sheet.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Once generated, the sheet can be edited if required. For example, due to the product bundles a particular modules might be added to teh branding, but the client will not be using that component of teh bundle. In which case it can be removed from the branding sheet.</p>
