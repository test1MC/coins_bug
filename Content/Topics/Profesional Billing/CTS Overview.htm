        <p class="Body">The information on these pages is designed to help staff complete their timesheets so that the resulting data provides an accurate picture to allow  departments to plan, forecast and measure how we deploy our human resources.</p>
        <p class="Body">Timesheets must be completed for each day.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Global development &amp; all US employees: Users should complete the timesheets by Monday for the preceding week.</li>
            <li>Non US Delivery &amp; Technical: Users should aim to complete timesheets regularly throughout the month, not leaving it until the very last minute.  Timesheets must be completed by the 2nd day of the following month.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">If you expect any absence (such as annual leave) complete your timesheets for these days in advance.</p>
        <p class="Body">You MUST complete your timesheets for the actual hours worked, not just 7.5 hours per day. If you don't work 7.5 hours in a single day there are Timesheet Activity codes you can use depending on the circumstances. For any time over and above the 7.5 hour day it is imperative you log all hours so we can report the actual resources being used within your department.</p>

        <p class="Body">In order to improve the accuracy of the timesheet data, our key objectives are:-</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Make Timesheet Entry Processes  Global - the US will be moving from TI to OA.</li>
                <li>Enable US specific Timesheet approval processes, and enable the US to use timesheet data as a source for payroll.</li>
                <li>Ensure that costs (and the corresponding revenue)  for client billable work are accurately recorded and reported for each territory. Inter-company timesheets will be for chargeable work only.</li>
                <li>Timesheet Activities for overheads  are recorded at departmental level contracts/jobs, rather than personal contracts/jobs (P Contracts). Analysis by individual will still be available where required</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">What is Changing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>New Timesheet Entry Screen (for US employees a new system for entering time)</li>
            <li>Revised Timesheet Activity List (For US Employees, a new way of entering time)</li>
            <li>New Overhead Contracts</li>
            <li>Revised PDR system integration with timesheets</li>
            <li>Revised accounting entries made when posting timesheets.</li>
        </ul>
