        <h1>Other administration tasks </h1>
        <p>As well as the standard processes above, a timesheet administrator will need to address the following:</p>
        <h2>Amending SHO Lines</h2>
        <p>Where a Timesheet Activity is not available to an employee, then it may be necessary to add a SHO Line, and transfer some of the professional services budget from an existing line into the new line. This request will normally be made by a Project Manager, or by an Account Manager. Adding the SHO line will create the cost code / Timesheet Activity that will allow the employee to enter time against the SHO.</p>
        <h2>Closing a SHO or SHO Lines</h2>
        <p>To prevent further time bookings, a SHO can be closed (which closes all SHO lines and prevents any further timesheet entry). In rare cases, individual SHO Lines can be closed to prevent a particular timesheet activity from being used. </p>
        <h2>SHO Not Yet Created, and “Special SHOs”</h2>
        <p>If the employee doesn’t have a SHO provided by the Account Manager or PM, the advice given to non US employees is to book the time to the 9999 SHO. There are additional territory specific procedures with regard to “special SHOs”. The timesheet administrator needs to be aware of these processes so that they can give guidance to employees (especially new employees).</p>
        <h2><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cost Head caps" /> (Cost Type) mapping</h2>
        <p>Under Home &gt; Professional Billing &gt; PB Maintenance &gt; <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cost Head caps" /> Mapping</p>
        <p>The purpose of the screen is to create additional SHO based Cost Codes not specifically created in the SHO Lines. The main examples related to employee services (rather than software products) are expenses and travel time.</p>
        <p>This is a mostly static maintenance screen that will only need reviewing if and when new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cost Heads caps" /> are added, or existing codes are used in a new combination not previously allowed for. If there are problems entering records e.g. travel time, it may be because there is some issue with some new Cost Heads that have not been added into this mapping table, or else a new process uses existing Cost Heads in a way not previously catered for.</p>
        <h2>Update Manager on JC Timesheets / Professional Billing items</h2>
        <p>Under Home &gt; Professional Billing &gt; PB Maintenance &gt; Update Manager on JC Timesheets / Professional Billing Items</p>
        <p>A Project Manager may request a SHO be assigned to him/her. After doing so in the SHO workbench it is also necessary to re-stamp any in flight transactions by using this utility. The default is to re-stamp unposted timesheets and unbilled (outstanding) PB lines. The person using this utility must ALWAYS specify the contract, and nearly always the SHO, otherwise with program will run for a very long time. To avoid large output the PDF and XML output should be unticked. </p>
