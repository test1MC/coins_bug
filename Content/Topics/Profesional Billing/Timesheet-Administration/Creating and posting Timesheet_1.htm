        <h1>Creating and posting Timesheet Batches </h1>
        <p>The first step (after any required timesheet approvals have been completed) is to create the timesheet batch:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PB/Timesheet-Administration/Creating and posting Timesheet_1.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PB/Timesheet-Administration/Creating and posting Timesheet_1_1.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>If the reference is left blank, the system will generate the reference. A manually entered reference can be used. The Description defaults to blank – typically an entry such as the one above is made.</p>
        <p>The “To” date needs to be entered. Care is required on the date entered and the timing around week end dates and month end dates. There should be a separate guidance note on this, but the assumption is that it would normally be the most recent week ending date (as used during Contract Timesheet Entry). This is Sunday in the UK and Australia, Friday in the US, Saturday in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>The next step is to Post the timesheet batch (select JC &gt; Timesheets &gt; Timesheet Batches, then go to the last batch).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PB/Timesheet-Administration/Creating and posting Timesheet_1_2.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PB/Timesheet-Administration/Creating and posting Timesheet_1_3.png" style="z-index: 1;visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;mso-wrap-distance-left: 9pt;mso-wrap-distance-top: 0;mso-wrap-distance-right: 9pt;mso-wrap-distance-bottom: 0;mso-position-horizontal: left;mso-position-horizontal-relative: text;mso-position-vertical: top;mso-position-vertical-relative: text;margin-left: 0;width: 249px;height: 38px;" />
            <br />Select the batch and run the Post Action at the bottom.</p>
        <p>After posting is completed the record status changes as shown below</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PB/Timesheet-Administration/Creating and posting Timesheet_1_4.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">The status does not change to “posting” during the process – it remains as Unposted until it completes the posting.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">The above assumes that the GL parameter AUTPOST is set to Y, otherwise there will be an additional GL batch posting step.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
