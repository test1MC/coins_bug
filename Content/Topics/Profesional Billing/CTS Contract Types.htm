            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" /> How It Works - Client Contract/Job &amp; SHO &amp; Project Stages</h1>
        <p class="Body">There are different Contract/Job Types available.</p>
        <p class="Body">The contract/job is effectively the client. There are potentially three contracts for each client - N1nnn, N4nnn or N5nnn, where nnn is a common 3 digit number for the client. The first letter is typically for the territory: N for North America, C for UK, M for Middle East, A for Australia.</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>C1nnn/N1nnn is for new implementations, or major implementations in existing clients.</li>
                <li>C4nnn/N4nnn is for ongoing work with existing clients</li>
                <li>C5nnn/N5nnn is not for timesheet entry, and no longer used for recording Support effort. It is only for recurring revenues.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="Body">If permission has been given to access a "foreign territory" client contract/job and SHO, you can do so – by first selecting the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Company (kco), then the  contract/job within the selected kco. Contract/job security needs to be enabled for the user to post time to that "foreign client contract/job &amp; SHO".</p>
        <p class="Body">The Contract/Job Section is the SHO. The sales function create and populate an Excel template for a SHO, which is then used to set up the SHO record in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> by a SHO set up administrator (Julie Clark for the UK, Ireland, Australia, Middle East. &lt;tbc&gt; for the US).</p>
        <p class="Body">Account Managers or Project Managers should advise employees of the SHO to be used for the timesheet entry.</p>
        <p class="Body">The SHO Budget (Revenue, Cost and Hours) will have been uploaded into Contract/Job &amp; SHO. The Hours uploaded appears as the Current Budget in timesheet entry. </p>
        <p class="Body">If your hours entered exceed the budget figure, data entry will still be allowed and the excess hours will appear in exception reporting.</p>
        <p class="Body">The budget load creates the permitted Timesheet Activities available for that SHO (by creating the relevant Cost Codes)</p>
        <p class="Body">For Client Contracts/Jobs &amp; SHOs only, the new Contract Timesheet entry screen requires the entry of an “Activity”, as shown in the screen shot below.</p>

        <p class="Body">The SHO set up will restrict the options available to those defined in the SHO.</p>
