        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">PDR&#160;Process</h2>
        <p class="Body">The PDR Workbench is used by the Development Team, Documentation Team and the QA Team to manage the key elements of the software development lifecycle of new and updated functionality.</p>
        <p class="Body">The key objective of the PDR workbenches is to provide a Product based view (rather than client or commercial) of changes made to the core <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> product during a release cycle.</p>
        <p class="Body">It provides status and progress reporting as well being a tool for planning, scheduling and managing all the tasks required throughout the software development lifecycle.</p>
        <p class="Body">&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">Each PDR has tasks associated with it for each of the key stages, specification, development, system testing.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images_P-R/PB/PDRWB_8.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="Body">PDR (Development) Tasks are the key to the accurate management, planning, scheduling and reporting of PDR Progress. All individuals that are assigned a PDR task, whether it be specification, development or testing must maintain, update and complete the information on their tasks.</p>
        <p class="Body">PDR/Development Tasks can be assigned to any individual within the business for action. This is usually done by the Regional Development Managers and the QA Manager.</p>
        <p class="Body">It is an individual's responsibility to ensure that their tasks are kept up to date at all times. Information on maintaining tasks is available here on the Exchange. This includes developers, testers, documenters, business analysts and development project managers.</p>
        <p class="Body">During the regular specification, development or testing phases of a PDR both the Forecast Hours to Complete and Status fields should be updated twice weekly by the task owners.</p>
        <p class="Body">Everybody who works on any element of a PDR MUST record their time spent accurately. This is especially critical for client funded PDRs.</p>
        <p class="Body">Historically the PDR Workbench was linked to Contracts in Company 10. As from Spring 2016 this link has been removed and the costing for timesheets will come from the PDR itself. This allows the correct analysis of both <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> funded development and Client funded development including any inter-company postings that may be required for Professional Billing.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2" MadCap:autonum="1.2 ">Creating the timesheet record from the PDR system</h2>
        <p class="Body">On each of the various workbenches (PDR Workbench, Developers Workbench, Testers Workbench) the Task Browse tab has been enabled with a Choose Action which will both update the Forecast Hours to Complete and automatically create the appropriate timesheet entry for an individual.</p>
        <p class="Body">The user can select the appropriate task and select ‘Create Time Sheet Record’</p>
