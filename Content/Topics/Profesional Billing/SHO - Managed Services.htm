        <p>This section records the sale of managed services such as Hosting and Disaster Recovery</p>
        <p>For 1 year deals, the columns for year 2 onwards will not be populated. However, if the deal is recorded as a longer period, the columns for each additional year will populate automatically. The number of years to be populated is specified by entering the No. of Years in the SHO header information.</p>
        <p>To counter the effects of inflation, the Increase boxes allow for a percentage increase to be specified for each subsequent year.</p>
