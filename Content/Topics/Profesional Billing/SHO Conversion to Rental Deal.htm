            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />SHO Conversion to Subscription Deal</h1>
        <p>Subscriptions are calculated by effectively spreading the cost of a traditional ILF/ALF deal over an agreed period and adding the appropriate uplift for each year.</p>
        <p>If you are setting up a subscription deal, it is recommended that you first create the SHO as a standard ILF/ALF deal, so that all the correct total figures are calculated, and then converting the SHO to a subscription deal. You will then be assured of the correct figures being apportioned across the term of the deal.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Once you have created the ILF/ALF&#160;SHO, conversion to a Subscription is achieved by returning to the Sales Handover section and changing the <b>Type</b> from ILF/ALF to Rental</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">

        </p>
        <p>You should also ensure the correct number of years has been specified.</p>
        <p>Now, locate the <b>Rental</b> column in the Financial Summary</p>
        <p>If you are selling a Rental agreement, the Rental Column must be populated with YES. Leaving this blank, or Entering No will result in the Rental Calculation elsewhere in the SHO not calculating.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>By setting the Yes in the Rental Column for each item sold, the Rental Value column will then calculate the full rental Value</p>

        <h2>Subscription Terms</h2>
        <p>If you are selling a Subscription deal this section <b>must</b> be completed</p>
        <p> The Rental amount will be pulled down from the Financial Summary, </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images_P-R/PB/SHO_example24.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Enter the appropriate Rental Uplift (fees to be charges per annum) 4%, 5% or 6% are currently available from the drop down.</p>
        <p>Specify the Invoicing Period. Monthly, Quarterly, Six month or Annual. </p>
        <p class="note">Due to the administration overhead that it creates, Monthly invoicing should only be considered in extreme circumstances. As a rule, you should not be agreeing to any terms shorter than 3 months.</p>
        <p>Once the Invoicing Period has been entered, the Rental Amount per period will be calculated along with the number of payments to be made.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images_P-R/PB/SHO_example25.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Specify the Deposit Periods (the number of invoice periods that will form the deposit). For a new customer this should be a default of 2. The deposit value should be sufficient to cover <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />'s incidental costs (Progress <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licences" /> etc.) when the project is given the go-ahead.</p>
        <p class="Example">If you have set the Inv. Period to Quarterly, entering 2 will specify that the deposit is the equivalent of 2 quarters (6 Months)</p>
        <p>The system will then calculate the deposit amount and remaining number of payments</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images_P-R/PB/SHO_example26.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deposit Invoice Date</li>
            <li>First Invoice Date</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">If you are doing a Rental Sale on a new contract, you should complete all your calculations in the new SHO and then transpose the figures into the contract. By doing this you will ensure that the SHO and the contract figures agree.</p>
