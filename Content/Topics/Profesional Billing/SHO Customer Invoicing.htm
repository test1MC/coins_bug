            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Customer Invoicing</h1>
        <p>This section allows notes to be recorded, for Karen and Julie, relating to how the deal should be billed if different to standard procedures.  For example the date of the first invoice if it is not to be billed immediately or any other details as to why this SHO differs from a standard deal..</p>
        <p>If billing will be standard, this section does not need to be completed.</p>

        <h2>ALF Invoicing Details</h2>

        </p>
        <p>This allows you to specify the ALF invoicing Details. It may be that at the time of the SHO these details are not known (Delivery may need to confirm Resource availability, for example), in which case notify Julie that the SHO can be processed but that billing is not to take place until further information is available.</p>
        <h2>Third Party Invoicing</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images_P-R/PB/SHO_example15.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>This allows you to specify the Third Party invoicing Details. Most importantly is the start  Progress ALF start and end dates. Ideally these should be the same as teh <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> ALF start and end dates, although this may not always be possible.</p>

        <h2>Special Licensing</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images_P-R/PB/SHO_example16.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Use these boxes to notify billing of the quantities sold of any specialist/third party products that do not come under any other catagories.</p>
