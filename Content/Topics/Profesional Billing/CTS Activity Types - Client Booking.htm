            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />How It Works - Timesheet Activities used for Client Bookings </h1>
        <p class="Body">Timesheet Activities are the codes that defined the type of Activity you are performing. Timesheet Activities are mapped to Costheads / Cost Types and the Cost Category in the set up. In the new timesheet entry screen, Costhead / Cost Type and Cost Category are not available for update – the Timesheet Activity controls these codes.</p>
        <p class="Body">For client work the chargeable Timesheet Activities are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PRODIR	Project Director</li>
            <li>PROMAN 	Project Management</li>
            <li>CON…	Consultancy, e.g. CONFIN for Consultancy Financials</li>
            <li>TEC…	Technical Consultancy e.g. TECUPG for Upgrades, TECCON for consultancy, TECHWR for hardware</li>
            <li>DEVCON	Consultancy by Developers</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">For travelling to client sites there are the following Timesheet Activities</p>

        <table class="TableStyle-NoteIndent2" style="margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;mc-table-style: url('../../Resources/TableStyles/NoteIndent2.css');" cellspacing="0">
            <col class="TableStyle-NoteIndent2-Column-Column1" />
            <thead>
                <tr class="TableStyle-NoteIndent2-Head-Header1">
                    <th class="TableStyle-NoteIndent2-HeadD-Column1-Header1">
                        <p class="NoteHeader">NOTE:</p>
                    </th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr class="TableStyle-NoteIndent2-Body-Body1">
                    <td class="TableStyle-NoteIndent2-BodyA-Column1-Body1">
                        <p>For Chargeable PDRs there is one timesheet activity DEVPDR. Typically DEVPDR timesheet records will be generated by the global PDR system – the PDR set up will control the timesheet record created. As well as developers, system testers will also log their time via the PDR workbench.</p>
                        <p>If your expected Timesheet Activity is not available to use, it will be because the SHO Budget did not have your Timesheet Actvity scheduled. If there has been a change in the mix of professional services, then the Account Manager or the Project Manager needs to amend the SHO budget to enable your Timesheet Activity to be used.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="Body">From time to time, you may be trying to enter a timesheet but find that you cannot enter against an appropriate code.  If this is the case, it’s likely that a correction to the SHO is required.</p>
        <p class="Body">If this is the case,  enter your hours to the 9999 SHO.  You can come back later and correct the entries and allocate the correct SHO once the Timesheet Activity has been made available.</p>
        <p class="Body">Otherwise, post to one of the available Timesheet Activities and let the PM or Account manager amend through Professional Billing. Record the actual Timesheet Activity in the internal description if different from the Timesheet Activity your time has been booked to.</p>
