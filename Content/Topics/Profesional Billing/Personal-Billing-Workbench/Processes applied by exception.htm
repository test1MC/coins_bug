        <h1>Processes applied by exception</h1>
        <h2>Action – Cost Reallocation</h2>
        <p>This will allow miscoded time to be corrected by the PM. In the background, additional + an – timesheet postings will be made to reflect this action. </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Time booked to the wrong SHO can be moved. E.g. from SHO 9999 to the real SHO.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If there is a SHOFOC line in the SHO, then time can be moved from e.g. PROMAN, CONFIN to SHOFOC using this option.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Moving time between timesheet activities. Example: Where say CONPROC time had to be entered as CONFIN time because there was no CONPROC on the SHO. The PM can get Julie to create a CONPROC line on the SHO and move some of the sold days from CONFIN to CONPROC. The PM can then reallocate the CONFIN time to CONPROC. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Filter to No SHO Lines</h2>
        <p>Use filtering to display No SHO Lines. These will be occasional exceptions that should diminish over time. Please contact Bruce / Julie to get the SHO lines created OR re-allocate the coding per 2.1 above. The PM will need to enter the correct Rate, as these lines will have a zero rate. Check that the Amount calculates correctly.</p>
        <h2>Action - Deferred</h2>
        <p>Billing can be postponed by marking the PB line as Deferred. It is important that you review any Deferred Items each month to see whether they should now be billed, or marked as Never Bill.</p>
        <h2>Part Bill action (<MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> box selection) </h2>
        <p>This action bills the Bill Hours, but then creates a new PB line with the balance of hours (Timesheet Hours minus Bill Hours). The new line can be treated in the same way as any other unbilled line. The new line isn’t created until the original PB line is billed.</p>
        <h2>Entering a manual line for mileage, or non-mileage expenses</h2>
        <p>Below is an example entry for Mileage and Non-mileage entries. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PB/Personal-Billing-Workbench/Processes applied by exception.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note that you should </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Select Manual PB Line Entry column set (I may get the standard column set changed for Live use – not decided yet)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Enter the (a) Contract (b) SHO (c) Contract Activity = X and (d) XPS1 or XPS2 Product codes – the Costcode will then be auto-populated. Note: Do not enter XPS1 or XPS2 into Timesheet Activity, as this will not work.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Timesheet activity should not be entered </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The employee code should be entered</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The Invoice description should describe the expenses </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The Amount should be entered (no entry in Bill Hours or Rate) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Fixed Price&#160; </h2>
        <p>This is best illustrated in two examples:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>All Services are Fixed price</li>
            <li>Some service are rated and some fixed price</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Example 1</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>5 Days PROMAN </p>
        <p>15 Days CONFIN</p>
        <p>12 Days CONOAR</p>
        <p>SHO lines for above are zero billing rate</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Fixed price of £5000 per month for 6 months. SHO line set up CONNST qty = 6, rate = £5000.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Employees book to CONFIN, CONOAR, PROMAN</p>
        <p>Say in month one, 2 days PM time, 5 days CONFIN, 1 day CONOAR is booked.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">PM adds Manual PB Line, entering CONNST and the amount of £5000 in the Amount box.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Billing (Phase 1): allocate employee time and manual line as “To Manually Bill”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Repeat above for each month.&#160; </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Example 2</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Fixed price of £10,000 for Financial Training materials preparation.</p>
        <p>Also 10 days of Financial Training delivery at £950 per day.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Set up SHO lines:</p>
        <p>CONFIN – qty 10, rate £950</p>
        <p>CONNST – qty 1, rate £10,000</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Consultant books all of their time to CONFIN. Say Materials prep booked in month 1 and training delivery booked on Month 2.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In month 1:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Add manual PB line, entering employee, CONNST activity, amount of £10,000. Inv desc should state the charge is for Training Materials Preparation Fixed Price.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Billing (Phase 1): allocate employee time and manual line as “To Manually Bill”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In month 2:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 38pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Time booked is processed as PB time @ £950 per day in the normal way</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
