        <p>Use Invoice Workbench instead of Timesheet Analysis or Timesheet Cost Report. </p>
        <p>Always use the Global Billing Items tab, not the SHO tab. There will be further updates on the SHO Tab in later versions of this topic.</p>

        <h2>Phase 1 Manual billing</h2>
        <p>Phase 1 is about using PB instead of Timesheet extracts to create your manual bill. See 1.2 regarding the PB process where you create the invoice from PB yourself.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 38pt;" start="1">
            <li>Filter to Project Manager SHO, and check that all SHO’s you bill are displayed. If any are missing (or any are not yours) get Bruce or Julie to amend.</li>
            <li>Use Column set selection to display different field options. This is flexible, so we/you can easily add fields into the view you prefer.</li>
            <li>Use the Report Button (better than the excel Button) if you need to get data extracted – by running the report button you can add more fields into the extract than are displayed on the screen. Over time, when you are familiar with on screen processing, the need to extract data to Excel should diminish, but whilst you are learning the system, it is a useful cross check to the timesheet data you used when doing your billing.</li>
            <li>If required, use the two sort options on the display: Contract/SHO/Date or Contract/SHO/Employee</li>
            <li>Review and resolve any records with status “No SHO Lines” (see section 2 for more explanation).</li>
            <li>Review and resolve any records which have been miscoded, using “Cost Re-Allocation” (see section 2 for more explanation).</li>
            <li>Special rules apply for “non-standard” SHOs (see section 2 for more explanation):</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;margin-left: 74pt;" start="1">
            <li>SHO Line set up for “SHOFOC” – zero billing rate</li>
            <li>SHO Line set up for “CONNST” – non-standard rate</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 38pt;" start="8">
            <li>Update the Bill Hours on the PB records for billable items.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;margin-left: 74pt;" start="1">
            <li>Don’t create manual summary lines in PB. If you have many lines that need to be consolidated, put all the Bill Hours into one of the lines, and make the other lines have zero Bill Hours. All lines (including the zero Bill Hours lines) should flagged as “To Manually Bill”.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 38pt;" start="9">
            <li>Manual lines can be created for expenses (see section 2 for more explanation).</li>
            <li>Flag selected PB records as either</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;margin-left: 74pt;" start="1">
            <li>“To Manually Bill” (invoice prep), or </li>
            <li>Manually Billed (already invoiced, need to enter invoice reference), or</li>
            <li>Never Bill (will not be invoiced), or</li>
            <li>Deferred (need to confirm billing with client), or</li>
            <li>Leave as blank (action next month). </li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 38pt;" start="11">
            <li>Once you have done all of the status changes for all of your billing, you need to Apply your Changes (in Options, top right).&#160; </li>
            <li>If required, extract your data into Excel to check your billing. In Phase 2 this will be done using Print Proforma Invoice</li>
            <li>Julie will create the Manual Invoice, and apply back to your records that have “To Manually Bill” status Invoice by Invoice (SHO by SHO). This will change the status to Manually Billed and the PB records will change from “Billing Outstanding” to “Billed” </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Phase 2 Creating the Invoice from PB [Not ready for testing]</h2>
        <p>The phase requires the PB invoice layout to be completed. We have some development on the Form Designer to do, and configuration of the Form, to cater for summarisation.&#160; </p>
        <p>Steps 1 to 9 for the Phase 1 process applies. So testing and live use of the Phase 1 process will be relevant to this process.</p>
        <p>In Phase 2:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Step 10 have the following additional options: </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Select and apply action Print Proforma Invoice to view the output.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">If OK, then select and apply action “To Bill” (instead of “To Manually Bill”)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Apply action “Create Invoice”</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Step 13 will involve Julie posting the “PB invoices” and printing them using the appropriate PB Form.</li>
        </ul>
