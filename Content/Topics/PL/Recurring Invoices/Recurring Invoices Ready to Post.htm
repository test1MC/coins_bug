        <p class="Body">Recurring invoices will not be available to post (and will not be shown) if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The template of the recurring invoice is for a costed invoice and the cost distribution is missing, or there is an imbalance.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="COINS.UKOnly">The template is a multi-lines <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> invoice but no <MadCap:variable name="Variables.vat" /> distribution has been entered.</li>
            <li>The recurring invoice next period equals the last period and there exists a monthly invoice with a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.financial date" /> equal to the last/next period, then it can be assumed all monthly invoices have been posted.</li>
            <li>An unposted monthly invoice for the same supplier exists.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">To mark a recurring invoice type as ready to post, you can either select it and choose <span class="Function">Ready to Post</span> from the Choose Action list, or update it manually.</p>
