        <p>This screen allows you to distribute the cost across one or multiple lines as required.</p>
        <p>If the transaction is not linked to a Purchase Order, you will need to build up the cost code manually by entering (for example) the Contract, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Cost Head caps" />, Section and Category codes by using the lookup button <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PL/LMDAP0033/Select the add button_5.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 19px;height: 18px;" /> after each component is selected.</p>
        <p>For example: <br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PL/LMDAP0033/Provisional Costing Tab_1.png" class="FullWidth" MadCap:conditions="COINS.Pre-v1105" /></p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PL/LMDAP0033/PL-INV-0004-1108.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Click the Save button to save the line.&#160; This will automatically open up another costing line so that you can split the costs against multiple lines if required, selecting Save on each line.&#160; Once all lines are entered and saved, select the undo <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PL/LMDAP0033/Provisional Costing Tab_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 24px;height: 25px;" />button to end line entry.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PL/LMDAP0033/Provisional Costing Tab_3.png" style="left: 0;" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p class="note">The cost able amount and Distributed fields should match once all the cost lines have been entered. If these figures do not match, this indicates a costing imbalance between the invoice value and the figures distributed across the lines that must be corrected before the batch can be posted.</p>
        <p>Click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Next_Both.flsnp" /> to return to the Invoices screen where you invoice should now be displayed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PL/LMDAP0033/Provisional Costing Tab_4.png" class="FullWidth" MadCap:conditions="COINS.Pre-v1105" />

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PL/LMDAP0033/PL-INV-0005-1108.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>If you have more invoices to add to the batch you may click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Add_Both.flsnp" /> to continue invoice entry until all invoices are entered.</p>
        <p>Once all invoices are entered and fully costed, they will appear on the Invoices screen with the Status Unposted and you are ready to post the batch.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <MadCap:relationshipsProxy />
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">If the invoice status is shown as Cost Imbalance you will need to go back into that invoice and correct the costing distribution on the Provisional Costing tab.&#160; Any invoices showing Cost Imbalance will prevent the batch from posting.</p>
