        <h1>Add (or Amend Unposted) Invoice</h1>
        <p>This screen substantially revises the standard PL Invoice Entry screen in order to gain efficiencies of use pertinent to a Shared Service operation.</p>
        <p>The principal change is the entry of either the PO Number or the Cost Analysis before any other data.&#160; If the PO Number is found in only one of the companies that the user has access to, then the associated company number is assigned to the invoice.&#160; The same logic applies if no PO Number is entered but instead a Cost Analysis is entered.&#160; The derived company’s name is displayed on the right hand side of the screen and all screen value defaults, lookups and validation are shown with reference to this derived company.</p>
        <p>Unless otherwise stated, all validation remains the same as that implemented by the standard PL Invoice Entry routine.&#160; </p>
        <p>As each invoice is saved, it is inserted into (or moved to) a purchase invoice batch for the current user and PL financial period in the destination company.&#160; If no such un-posted PL batch already exists then it is created automatically.</p>
        <p>If there is no current PL financial period in the destination company, then the following error message displayed “No current PL period available for company ” and the save action rejected.</p>
        <p>As just stated, an invoice may need to be moved from one PL invoice batch to a batch in another company, this could happen any number of times.&#160; The system ensures that the batch totals of each of these batches ; corresponds correctly to the number of invoices in each batch.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="font-family: Wingdings;">@</span>Utilisation of this functionality, requires sound controls around the use of ”current” periods across companies.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Add (or Amend Unposted) Invoice – No Scan</h2>
        <p>The principal change is the entry of either the PO Number or the Cost Analysis before any other data.&#160; In the below example we are showing the PO functionality.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PL/LMDAP0040/Add or Amend Unposted Invoice.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Error messages will be displayed, indicating where there is more than one PO in existence across the companies. The drop down list or look up is available to the user.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Look up <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PL/LMDAP0040/Add or Amend Unposted Invoice_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 17px;height: 18px;" />, displays the brief order number details for all companies, giving the user the option to select. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The remaining input of the PL Invoice details, is as standard PL invoice entry routine.</p>
        <h2>Add (or Amend Unposted) Invoice – With Scan</h2>
        <p>This function appears on the standard <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> menu as illustrated below. This routine is operated in exactly the same way as its non-Shared Service equivalent.&#160; The user selects either the Batch or the Pool&#160; &amp; Bulk auto indexes the images.</p>
        <p>A PL invoice batch is created for the current user, for the current PL financial period and in the current logged-in company (i.e. NOT necessarily the user’s prime company).  “Empty” PL invoices are created and put in the PL invoice batch just created and a “pointer” record created in the Shared Serve PL invoice batch’s line table as shown below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PL/LMDAP0040/The remaining input of the.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note"> A specially formatted “Temporary Internal Reference”&#160; is generated for each “empty” invoice.&#160; The reason for doing this is because, by definition, Shared Service invoices may well end up in a different company&#160; and each company may have a different strategy for generating internal references.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_P-R/PL/LMDAP0040/The remaining input of the_1.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>As each invoice is saved, it is inserted into (or moved to) a purchase invoice batch for the current user and PL financial period in the destination company.&#160; If no such un-posted PL invoice batch already exists, then it is created automatically.</p>
        <p>If there is no current PL financial period in the destination company then the following error message displayed “No current PL period available for company ” and the save action rejected.</p>
        <p>As stated, an invoice may need to be moved from one PL invoice batch to a batch in another company.&#160; This, in theory, could happen any number of times.&#160; The system ensures that the batch totals of each of these batches, corresponds correctly to the number of invoices in each batch.</p>
        <h2>Post batches</h2>
        <p>Batches are posted by selecting them on the main Scanned Invoice Batches screens.&#160; All associated PL invoice batches in the various destination companies are posted. Example below: Enter invoices via Scan.</p>
