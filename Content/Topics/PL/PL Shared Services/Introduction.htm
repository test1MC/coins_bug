        <h1>PL Shared Services</h1>
        <p>The functionality described in this section is designed to address certain issues often associated with a typical Shared Service operation.</p>
        <p>The assumption is that the Shared Service operation enters, in this case, purchase ledger invoices on behalf of more than one operating company.&#160; Such invoices are typically entered (i.e. registered) and costed sometimes at a later stage, sometimes at the same time as invoice entry.</p>
        <p>This solution is designed to remove some of the more cumbersome tasks associated with invoice scanning and entry.</p>
        <p>The benefits of this approach include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prior to scanning, invoices no longer need to be sorted into different piles based on the destination company</li>
            <li>Separate PL batches no longer to be created by the user for each destination company</li>
            <li>Scanned invoices can be processed (i.e. data entered) from a single list with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> automatically recognising the destination company</li>
            <li>Reduced number of keystrokes required to enter a typical invoice</li>
        </ul>
