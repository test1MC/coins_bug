        <h1>Transfer Mechanisms</h1>
        <p>Whether you are considering a network capable scanning solution or the manual file transfer solution, there are two options supported by <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> for sharing the scanned documents with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <h2>File Transfer Protocol</h2>
        <p>This is the preferred solution for a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> environment. File Transfer Protocol, or FTP as it is also known, requires the configuration of a file transfer repository on the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> server. Any number of repositories can be created to cater for multiple companies and/or <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> environments. Each repository is secured via a user identifier and password.</p>
        <p>If utilising a network capable scanning solution, these repositories can be configured within the document scanners being used. End users will not be required to know the specific details of how to connect to a specific repository. User identifiers and passwords will be set up on the document scanning device and hidden from the end users.</p>
        <p>If considering the manual file transfer solution, then a third party file transfer utility like Filezilla or WinSCP will need to be installed on the computer of any user required to transfer invoice images. Users will be required to know the particular access details of each file repository that they need to deposit invoice images in.</p>
        <h2>Network Shares</h2>
        <p>Another option is to configure network file shares within your corporate environment. These file shares can then be configured to be accessible from the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> server. In this case user access privileges will be controlled by the platform providing the network share. An appropriate user account must be provided to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to enable the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> software to access the network share and manage the associated invoice images. Any number of sub-directories or network shares can be configured to act as image repositories.</p>
        <p>If utilising a network capable scanning solution, these network shares can be configured within the document scanners being used.&#160; End users will not be required to know the specific details of where on the network the images are being deposited. User identifiers and passwords will be set up on the document scanning device and hidden from the end users.</p>
        <p>If considering the manual file transfer solution, then users will be required to be assigned the necessary privileges to add invoice image files to the network share. Users can then move invoice image files using the standard Windows File Explorer.</p>
