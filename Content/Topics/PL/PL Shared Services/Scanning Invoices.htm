        <h1>Scanning Invoices</h1>
        <p>Loading scanned invoice into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can be performed by either the use of a network capable document scanner or by manually transferring invoice images to the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> server.</p>
        <p>The preferred option is to use a network capable scanner. In this case the document scanner can be configured to allow end users to scan documents to a pre-determined network resource that is automatically accessible from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />. This would normally be undertaken in conjunction with your internal IT support resources. Users would simply select the desired image repository from the document scanner, scan the invoices and then commence processing the images from within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p>If this capability is not available to your organisation, then a manual transfer mechanism must be used. Invoice images are scanned using the document scanner to a local computer. The end user must then manually transfer the files from the local computer to a network resource, which is accessible to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, prior to attempting to process any invoice images.</p>
