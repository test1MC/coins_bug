            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Electronic Invoice Load - Method</h1>
        <p>Complete the “Open_pinv” sheet on the attached template as per the <a href="Electronic Invoice Load - Data File Format.htm" target="_popup">format described</a>.</p>
        <p>

        <p>The Sheet “Sample” provides an example to refer to.</p>
        <p>Row 3 of the sheet contains all the required settings and formulas and can be copied down to Row 4 onwards for the number of lines required – 1 line per invoice to be loaded.</p>
        <p>Once the sheet has been completed, click on the “LOAD” sheet</p>
        <p>

        <p>This automatically populates with the data from “Open_Pinv” and creates the correct export format.  Verify that you have the same number of lines on each.  If there are more lines needed on “LOAD” simply copy the last line down the required number of lines – this will copy the formulas and automatically populate from the “Open_Pinv” sheet.   If there are more lines than invoices, delete the extra lines.</p>
        <p>Once you are happy that all the invoices are showing on “LOAD” click the Copy button on the top left of the sheet</p>
        <p>
