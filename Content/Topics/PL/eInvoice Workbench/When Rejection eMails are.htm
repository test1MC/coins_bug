            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />When Rejection eMails are produced</h1>
        <p>When EC/REJEMAIL parameter is set to REVIEW, rejection emails are produced when a batch of eInvoices is reviewed in the workbench. When set to REJECT, the emails are produced when the Reject button is pressed.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The parameter may be set to CREATE in which case rejection emails will be produced when the Create button is produced.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The parameter may be set to REVIEW,REJECT in which case, two emails will be produced for each invoice in error (once when reviewed and once when rejected). Emails are only produced according to the rules in the ‘eCommerce PL Invoice Validation’ program (ec2055.p). The same applies if the parameter is set to REVIEW.REJECT,CREATE.</p>
        <p>Leaving the parameter blank or setting it to NONE overrides the validation rules however they are set and no email is produced. The AUTOREJECT functionality is not affected by this parameter.</p>
