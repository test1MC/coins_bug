            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Overview</h1>
        <p>The transactions are sent by the COINSetc Hub as XML messages in a format that the eInvoice Workbench recognises<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p> The default XML format for the eInvoice Workbench is BASDA v3.9 with some small extensions.</p></MadCap:footnote>. The user of the eInvoice Workbench does not need to have, however, any concern about these technical issues. The Workbench interprets the messages and presents them in a regular <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> fashion. </p>
        <p>Transactions are routed to the correct <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Company Workbench where the XML data is validated. If it is good the transactions can be passed straight to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> and General Ledger as a batch in the usual way. Transactions that do not pass validation can be amended in the Workbench. From the Workbench an XML invoice can be viewed by the user as if viewing an image of a paper invoice. These images can be printed. </p>
        <p>For certain configurations Contract costing can be added to invoices.</p>
