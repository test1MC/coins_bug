            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Hold codes for eInvoices</h1>
        <p>Set the following PL parameters so that a default hold code appears when creating the batch from the eInvoice workbench.</p>
        <p>PL/DEFHOLD to Y</p>
        <p>PL/DEFHCODE to the default code you require</p>
        <p>If you want all registered invoices to be held, then set PL/HLDREGIN to Y. Registered invoices i.e. any that have not been able to be costed but are not in error on the workbench will be put on hold.</p>
        <p>For costed invoices, anything above the Supplier Authorisation limit (PL supplier details) will be put on hold, otherwise not.</p>
        <p>The PL/INVINPER parameter is used to ensure that only transactions dated in the current period are allowed through the manual entry. The workbench respects this parameter as well.</p>
