        <p>The top part of this split screen shows the messages that have been sent by suppliers and routed to the relevant <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Company. Clicking the Load button checks each invoice in the batch for exceptions. If there are no exceptions in the batch then you are prompted to pass them through to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> or open the Review Screen, the second page of the workbench, where the batch of individual invoices that are carried by any one message can be seen and can be processed. If there are any exceptions the Review screen is opened straight away. The column labelled Txns at the top on the right hand side shows how many invoices are contained in the message. </p>
        <p>Messages in the top half of the screen can be rejected by pressing the upper Reject  button. Rejected messages will not be passed into the workbench. The original batch of invoices in XML format can be seen by pressing the View  button.</p>
