        <p>A list of individual invoices is presented in this screen.&#160; If all work on the batch is complete click the green Forward button to return to the Load Pending screen to invoke the standard <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> batch creation program. When this process is complete a true PL batch of invoices is created from all invoices not held back in the workbench and without an exception flag<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p> If the PL/AUTOPSTE parameter is set to Y (or the PL/AUTOPSTE parameter is blank and the PL/AUTOPOST parameter is set to Y) the invoices are placed on the invoice register; otherwise an unposted batch of invoices is created to be dealt with later in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" />.</p></MadCap:footnote>. The Invoices will then be cleared from the workbench leaving only those purposely held or those that require further attention to resolve any exceptions. </p>
        <p>When all invoices in a message have been moved to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> the message is no longer visible in the workbench’s Load/Pending screen.</p>
        <p>An invoice for whatever reason that cannot be moved to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> will be flagged as an exception and the exception will be showm in the Status column. Hover over this entry to see more detail.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Filters to show only those invoices that have been flagged as exceptions, only invoices that have been individually rejected, or only those invoices that are held in the workbench are available. Options to hold or to unhold all invoices in the batch are available.</p>
        <p>How the supplier account is sought is determined by the PL/ACCNODEF parameter<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p> The parameter can be overridden on a supplier by supplier basis by giving the &lt;AccountNumberDefault&gt; tag in the eCommerce Configuration HUB record a supplier specific value.</p></MadCap:footnote>. If set to PO and the invoice XML refers to a valid purchase order in the current <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> company then the supplier account is drawn from the purchase order<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p> The workbench will use the PL Account number derived from the PO even if it is for supplier other than the one sending the message. In this case an exception is indicated.</p></MadCap:footnote>. If set to MSG the contractor’s supplier account code is thought to be known to the supplier, or the ETC hub, and it is contained in the &lt;BuyersCodeForSupplier&gt; tag in the XML.</p>
        <p>The transaction type is set initially from the BASDA-<MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /><MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p> See the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> eCommerce Configuration Guide for more information about setting up BASDA-<MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> mappings. </p></MadCap:footnote> mapping and typically it is one that requires the invoice to reference a Purchase Order (commonly called INV or PINV transactions). </p>
        <p>The original XML message for a particular invoice can be seen by pressing the button in the View column; a more readable view of the message can be seen by pressing the button in the Render column; if the invoice was sent using the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Outsourced Invoice process, where each invoice form the supplier is scanned and an image sent through to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, that image can be seen by pressing the button in the Scanned Image column.</p>

        <p>More detail about an invoice can be seen in a new screen by clicking the underlined entry in the Supplier Reference column and, if possible, any exceptions can be resolved there.&#160; If an exception can’t be resolved the invoice will remain in the workbench.</p>

        <p>In the Details screen, the order number and the invoice transaction type may be changed. A unique invoice reference number for the supplier and a valid contract will be required. Some supplier’s may be able to send you costing information in the XML message if so the costing distribution can also be entered on pop-up form using the data sent by the supplier and preset defaults<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p> See the Appendix HOW TO Change PINV to PINN also published on <a href="http://www.coins-global.com"><span class="Hyperlink">www.coins-global.com</span></a> for more information about the configuration of this option.</p></MadCap:footnote>. </p>
        <p>You can change the VAT distribution and the financial hold code. Default values for the financial hold code are enabled by the PO/HLDOKCRN and PO/HLDOKINV parameters. The parameters PL/EAUTOMHI and PL/EAUTOMHC if set blank will overrule PO/HLDOKINV and PO/HLDOKCRN treating them always as NO<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p> For more information see the Appendix HOW TO Hold Transactions in the eInvoice Workbench also published on www.coins-global.com.</p></MadCap:footnote>.</p>
        <p>If an invoice is associated with a Supplier that is also linked to a Subcontractor record in the same company (they share the same account code), or the associated PO is flagged to be for operated plant then a Labour Content component can be noted on the invoice. If the PL/LABCONT% parameter has a value this is used to determine what percentage of the total invoice value will be allocated as a Labour Content value.</p>
        <p>An associated purchase order can seen by pressing the underlined entry in the Purchase Order column. You can view the invoice line details of by selecting the Lines tab.  </p>
        <p>Pressing Addresses tab shows the Invoice To and Deliver To addresses as sent in the XML message.</p>
