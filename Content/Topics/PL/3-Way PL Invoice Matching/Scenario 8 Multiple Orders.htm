        <p>Where more than one purchase order has been entered for a supplier they may send one invoice covering all those purchase orders.&#160; </p>
        <ol style="font-family: Calibri;font-size: 11pt;">
            <li>Enter the Invoice in the normal way, note that the net value entered will be for the total of the purchase orders being invoiced.</li>
            <li>When the Matching screen appears enter the details of the first purchase as per normal, and apply a manual match.</li>
            <li>To enter the details of one or more purchase order use the Options menu and Select another PO.</li>
            <li>You will be prompted to enter the Purchase Order Number.</li>
            <li>The Matching screen is displayed with the goods received note information for the order.&#160; If the screen is blank then no goods have been received.</li>
            <li>If the goods have been received you can apply a manual match to the invoice</li>
            <li>There should be no difference once all relevant purchase orders have been matched to the invoice.&#160; </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The invoice can then be posted.</p>
