        <p>The Matching Tab will show all of the Goods Received Notes (GRN’s) that have been entered into the system against the order number and are ready to be matched.</p>
        <ol style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Calibri;">
            <li>Identify the Goods Received note that relates to the invoice you are matching.&#160; The ticket number on the invoice should match the ticket number shown on the screen.</li>
