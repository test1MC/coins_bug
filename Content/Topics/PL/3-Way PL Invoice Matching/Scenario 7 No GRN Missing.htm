            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Scenario 7 – No GRN (Missing Ticket)</h1>
        <p>This scenario can occur when the goods have been received, but the delivery ticket number is missing from the system.&#160; Once proof of delivery has occurred, then a missing ticket can be input at the same time as entering the suppliers invoice.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Invoice Batch is created and the Invoice details entered</li>
            <li>On the Matching Tab some, or all, of the lines relating to the items may not be available for matching </li>
            <li>Contact the buyer and establish that there is proof of delivery and it is just that the ticket is missing in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, then select Options.</li>
            <li>From the Options menu select Missing Ticket</li>
            <li>The Goods Received Note screen is displayed for the missing ticket details to be entered.</li>
            <li>Once entered, the Matching tab appears and the Invoice can now be matched.</li>
            <li>Post the batch</li>
        </ol>
