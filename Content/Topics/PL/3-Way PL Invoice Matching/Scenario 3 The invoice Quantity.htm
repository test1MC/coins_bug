            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Scenario 3 – The invoice Quantity is greater than the GRN Quantity</h1>
        <p>If the supplier has made a partial delivery of the goods with the balance to follow at a later date, but invoiced you for the full amount, the most likely scenario is that your business process is to reject the invoice until the full goods have been delivered.&#160; Should you need to process the invoice in this situation, the following process applies.</p>
        <p>The Invoice Value and the Value Available will not match on the matching tab.&#160; This must still be matched as a whole quantity on the system.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the appropriate invoice matching line for the partial delivery using the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> box.&#160; </li>
            <li>Select the Action Match Whole Quantity from the action dropdown list and select the Apply Action button.</li>
            <li>The Quantity Invoiced column will update, and the Status will show Matching Imbalance. The Matched amount at the bottom of the screen should now be populated and the Difference will be the unmatched value remaining.</li>
            <li>Select the Forward button to return to the batch listing screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You will now be able to Post the batch, but the Invoice cannot be paid until the balance of goods has been matched on the system, or a credit note entered for the outstanding quantities.</p>
