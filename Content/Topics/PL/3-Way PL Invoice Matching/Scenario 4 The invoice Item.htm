            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Scenario 4 – The invoice Item Price is lower than the Order Item Price</h1>
        <p>In situations where the correct amount of goods have been delivered, but the supplier has charged you a lower price than that on the Purchase order, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will allow you to enter this without resulting in any errors.</p>
        <p>For example, 10 items ordered at <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />120.00 each.&#160; Invoice is received for 10 items at <MadCap:variable name="Variables.$" />100.00</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the Invoice matching line</li>
            <li>Change the Invoice Price amount to that on the Invoice</li>
            <li>Save the line</li>
            <li>The Quantity Invoiced column will update.&#160; The Matched amount at the bottom of the screen should now be populated and the Difference should be zero.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> The Invoice is now matched.</p>
