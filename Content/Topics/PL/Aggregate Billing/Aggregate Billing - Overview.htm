        <p class="Body">New functionality has been introduced for aggregate supplies: output from weighbridge software can be used to create dispatch records. The dispatches are then charged using the existing prices and customer agreement functionality to create charges. The customer charges create <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /></span> invoices. The invoice print can include details such as the truck ID from the original load file.</p>
        <p class="Body">A new web service is available to load dispatch files.  ESB Transformation can be used to take files, transform them as required and feed in to this web service.</p>
