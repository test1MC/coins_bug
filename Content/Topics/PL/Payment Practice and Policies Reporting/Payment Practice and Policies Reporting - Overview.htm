            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.ScreenOnly">Payment Practice and Policies Reporting - </MadCap:conditionalText>Overview</h1>
        <p>In 2015, the UK government introduced legislation requiring large businesses to publish details of their payment practices and performance.  The implementation of this legislation was delayed but now applies to accounting periods starting on or after 6 April 2017.</p>
        <p>The new reporting requirements apply to all UK companies and LLPs that do not qualify as micro, small or medium-sized for Companies Act accounting purposes.  These large businesses will need to publish details of their payment practices and performance twice per year.</p>
        <p>The guidance published by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on 31 January 2017 details which companies have a duty to report, when and where the reports have to be published, and what information needs to be published.  Clients should refer to this guidance for details (including whether your company will have a duty to report).  The first reports will be due by 4 November 2017 for companies with accounting years starting on 6 April 2017.</p>
        <p>Some of the information to be reported is text or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />boxes concerning business policies and processes.  This information would not come from the accounting records.  However, there are three types of statistics to be reported which would need to calculated from the accounting records in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p>Statistics to be reported</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="PPPStats.flsnp" />
        <p>These statistics need to cover both <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> and Subcontract Ledger payments.  Certain types of payment are excluded (mainly those for financial services or those without a significant connection to the UK).</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.Superseded in 1109">Like many accounting systems, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> does not currently have a field on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> invoice input for “Date Received”. On </MadCap:conditionalText>
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.v1109">The “Date Received” field on <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> invoice input is optional, and is controlled by a parameter, therefore the received date may or may not be available on the invoice. However, on </MadCap:conditionalText> every invoice, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> requires users to input the Invoice Date and <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> automatically records the date the invoice is posted in the ledger.  The date of receipt of the invoice will generally lie between these two dates. </p>
        <p>A new report can be used to help calculate the necessary statistics from data already held in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.  This allows users to apply assumptions as to the relationship between the date received and dates already held on transactions<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.v1109">, if the date received is not available</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <p>The new report does not require any changes to data input in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.  This enables clients to use the new report immediately even if much of the data to be reported on has been input prior to implementation of this software enhancement.</p>
