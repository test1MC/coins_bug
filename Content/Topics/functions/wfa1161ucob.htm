You would need to do this if you entered a disposal reversal by mistake (for example, for the wrong asset).  You need to do this, rather than simply dispose of the asset again, because if the asset has depreciated in the meantime, the postings to the Depreciation and P&amp;L On Sale accounts would be incorrect.
