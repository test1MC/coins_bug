<span class="function" title="Function:%WFA2010BFAG">Asset Groups</span> allows you to maintain your asset groups.  Asset groups save you time and effort when entering assets. An asset "inherits" the characteristics of the group it belongs to, so you can use asset groups to set up defaults.

You should give some thought to setting up asset groups. For example, it might be more sensible to set up several groups for different types of dump truck, each with different <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc hire"/> rates, than to have a single group for dump trucks and have to enter new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc hire"/> rates for each asset.
