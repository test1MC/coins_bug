        <p><span class="function" title="Function:%WFA2150FFAA">Depreciation Type Conversion</span> allows you to change from the non-cumulative method of depreciation to the cumulative method (see <a href="../WD/WDFA0010_Depreciation_Types.html">Depreciation Types</a>).</p>

                    <p>Before the conversion, you can produce a report showing the effect conversion will have. You can then note assets whose value would change significantly (for example, if the purchase transaction was posted a long time after the actual purchase), and change the details for those assets after you have run the conversion.</p>
                    <p>The report works by calculating depreciation by the old method and by the cumulative method. If you run the report, you must do so <strong>before</strong> depreciation has been calculated, or <strong>after</strong> depreciation has been posted. You can use the Depreciation Type Exceptions report (see Depreciation Type Exceptions) to report on assets whose depreciation method has been changed, or for which manual depreciation has been entered (that is, the calculated amount has been overridden).</p>
