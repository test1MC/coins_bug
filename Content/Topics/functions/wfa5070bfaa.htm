<p><span class="function" title="Function:%WFA5070BFAA">Parts</span> shows any assets that are part of this asset.  Parts can be used if you want to depreciate part of an asset on a different basis - for example the slewing ring in a tower crane has a much shorter life than the crane.  You can also use this if you want to have distinct service history for the parts.  When using parts only the base (primary) asset is dispatched.</p>
