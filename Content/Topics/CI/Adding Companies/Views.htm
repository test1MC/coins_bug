        <p>There are different views within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> relating to the CIW. This can be used to restrict the User Views to specific levels; up to four levels are available. </p>
        <p>In the example below, we have two levels, i.e. Database and Company level. The Company level in this case is an office or branch.</p>

        </p>
        <p>All records are held at the database level and therefore need to be located and selected by adding the record to your view. Without adding the record to your view you will not be able to place any orders for that supplier.</p>
        <p>By maintaining your list, you can only use and list the local suppliers that you will use and therefore not have the additional list of subcontractors and plant hire companies.</p>
