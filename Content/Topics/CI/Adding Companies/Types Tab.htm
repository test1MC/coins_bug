        <p>The Company Types is available to enable you to search on types of companies. Select the company types that are associated with the company, as you can allocate more than one. For example the company could be a supplier of materials, a subcontractor or a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc hire" /> company.</p>

        <p>Select the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box adjacent to all the required company types. A company must have at least one type (for example, supplier). </p>
