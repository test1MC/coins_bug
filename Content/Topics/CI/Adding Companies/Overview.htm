            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Overview</h1>
        <p>The Company Information Workbench is a database of all the companies you deal with; for example: suppliers, subcontractors, clients, architects, solicitors, and so on.&#160; The Company Information Workbench is "global" - that is, it is not restricted to a single <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> company (kco).&#160; You should only have one record in the Company Information Workbench for each company you deal with.</p>
        <p>This explains how to add a new Supplier to the Central Repository.</p>
        <p>The Central Repository can be separated into up to five levels of view, from Database/Group (Level 1), down to Region, or even Office level (Level 5 being the lowest level). Users are set up with a base view, between levels 2-5. A user will have access to go up levels, to view larger subsets of the Central Repository. When adding a new Supplier, it will be added to your base view as well as the levels above it. For example for a level 3 user (for example, Regional view), the new Supplier will be added to level 3, and also to level 2 (Company) and level 1 (Group/Database).</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #bed230;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">A Company should only be recorded in the Company Information Workbench <b>once</b>, although it is possible to have many offices linked to the company as required. For example, Jewson has a head office and many branch/offices around the UK.</p>
