            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Deleting a Record from a View</h1>
        <p>To keep your list current and have only the records that you need you should maintain the list regularly. 
The easiest way to remove a supplier that you no longer use is to delete the record from your view. 
</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #bed230;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">This will not delete the record within the system. It will only remove it from your view. It will still be available in the Database.</p>
        <p>On the Companies Workbench,  
 
select the view that you wish to maintain (any level below Database) from the drop-down list in the Level field and click Apply Filter.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Locate the record that you wish to remove from your view.</p>
        <p>Select the Tick Box adjacent to the record you require. This will highlight the record. (You can select a number of records by using the Ctrl key or the Shift key).</p>
        <p>Select the Delete from View option from the dropdown list and select the Apply Action button. </p>

        </p>
        <p>The record will be removed from the view. (It will not remove the record from the Database list).</p>
