        <p>At the heart of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is the Central Repository. This has been designed specifically for the Construction Industry and provides a central location for static data and is shared by the primary business processes. It provides users with the information relating to companies, their offices and the projects. It has been designed to automatically update when events occur from other business processes.</p>
        <p>The Central Repository uses the System Administrator module and can be configured to run with the operational modules such as Financials and Procurement.</p>
