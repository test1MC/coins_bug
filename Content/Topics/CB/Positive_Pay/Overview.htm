        <p>Positive Pay is a process developed by the banks to mitigate the risk of physical <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> fraud. Prior to a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> being presented for payment a data file is transmitted to the bank with information about the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" />(s) released by the organ<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ation. If the information on the transmittal file matches the information on the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> then the transaction is cleared by the bank. If there is a mismatch of information then an exception is created and the company is contacted prior to clearing the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" />. There is no standard format for the Positive Pay transmittal and each bank has its own standards.</p>
