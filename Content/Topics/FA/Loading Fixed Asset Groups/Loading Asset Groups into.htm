        <h2>Fixed Asset Group Load</h2>
        <p>Navigate to Fixed Assets &gt; Administration &gt; Fixed Asset Group Load</p>
        <p>Click on the “Choose File” button </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_D-F/Fixed Assets/Loading Fixed Asset Groups/Loading Asset Groups into_10.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the file just saved as previously shown and ensure “Upload Mode” is set to “Check”. </p>
        <p>Then Click on the “Next” button</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_D-F/Fixed Assets/Loading Fixed Asset Groups/Loading Asset Groups into_11.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Check the Report Status queue for the report titled “Fixed Asset Group Load” to see if there are any issues with the load file. If there are issues the report will detail which lines are the offending lines. Those lines will need to be corrected and re-uploaded in “Check” mode until they have all been checked successfully.</p>
        <p>An example of an issue such as missing data that is required:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_D-F/Fixed Assets/Loading Fixed Asset Groups/Loading Asset Groups into_12.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_D-F/Fixed Assets/Loading Fixed Asset Groups/Loading Asset Groups into_13.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Once any errors have been corrected and they have all been checked successfully re-upload in “Load” mode</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_D-F/Fixed Assets/Loading Fixed Asset Groups/Loading Asset Groups into_14.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Again, check the Report Status queue for the report titled “Fixed Asset Group Load” to see if there are any issues with the load file. If there are issues the report will detail which lines are the offending lines. Those lines will need to be corrected and re-uploaded in “Load” mode.</p>
        <p>*NOTE*</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: Orange;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">If there are any issues with some of the lines, only those lines will need to be re-uploaded. Some Asset Groups will have been uploaded successfully so do not attempt to re-upload them again otherwise an error message will appear on the report stating the same.</p>
        <p>Alternatively you can use the tickbox “Overwrite Existing Asset Group” and upload all lines (those that have been loaded and those that haven’t):</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_D-F/Fixed Assets/Loading Fixed Asset Groups/Loading Asset Groups into_15.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>To see the Asset Groups that have been uploaded navigate to Fixed Assets &gt; Setup &gt; Maintenance &gt; Asset Groups</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_D-F/Fixed Assets/Loading Fixed Asset Groups/Loading Asset Groups into_16.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Now that these Asset Groups have been loaded into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, move them into the “Loaded” section of the Master Asset Register Load file</p>
        <p>
