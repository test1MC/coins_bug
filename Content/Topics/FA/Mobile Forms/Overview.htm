        <p>You can now set up mobile forms for assets – these could be used for daily inspections. The forms use Responsive Design and can be updated on a mobile device connected to the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> database.</p>
        <p>Mobile forms can be set up to automatically produce a PDF document and store it, as well emailing the report and triggering workflows based on the input. One of the big potential uses would be LOLER inspections (Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations), as these require you to be able to produce the historical reports.</p>
