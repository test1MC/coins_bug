        <p>Asset Captions are user-defined fields on the asset record that allow you to record additional information about the asset.</p>
        <p>Triggers allow you to keep track of when events related to plant or vehicle assets are due. Triggers expire when certain criteria are met (for example, when a vehicle has reached a given mileage or when a plant item has been used for a given number of hours); when a trigger expires, this indicates that an event (such as a service or an insurance renewal) is due.</p>
        <p>Triggers and captions can be used independently of each other.  However, triggers can also be linked to captions, so that you can update multiple triggers from a single caption.  </p>
        <p class="Example"><b>Example:</b> There might be various things you want to do to a plant item depending on the number of hours it has been used, such as an inspection, changing oil, or changing filters.  These may happen after different periods of use, and could all be set up as separate triggers which are updated from an "hours use" caption.</p>
        <p>To get the full benefit of trigger functionality you need the data kept up to date, and the entry should happen as part of day to day processing, rather than as a tandem process.  To this end you can set captions to be updated at various points during the hire cycle, for example as part of dispatch or return (see Linking Triggers to Captions).  Some triggers are date-based so have no need to input the current value.</p>
