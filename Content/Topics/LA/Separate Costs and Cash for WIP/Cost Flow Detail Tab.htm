        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Cost Flow Detail Tab</h2>
        <p class="Body" style="page-break-after: avoid;">This is similar in format to the detailed cash flow tab and has the same functionality except as detailed below.</p>
        <p class="Caption" MadCap:autonum="Figure 2: ">Costflow Detail Screen</p>

        <p class="Body">The Cost Flow figures are calculated in the same way that Detailed Cash Flow figures were previously calculated and are updateable in the same ways (direct input or using a distribution method). The detailed cash flow figures are calculated from the cost flow figures (see <MadCap:xref href="#Detailed">1.2, <i>Detailed Cash Flow Tab </i></MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <p class="Body">The Cost Flow tab includes Income so that all allocation to periods can be done on a single screen.</p>
        <p class="Body">The Recalculate Finance and ROCE matrix option is not available on the Cost Flow tab. The Finance and ROCE and IRR figures all continue to be based on the Cash Flow figures.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.2 "><a name="Detailed"></a>Detailed Cash Flow Tab</h2>
        <p class="Body">The Detailed Cash Flow tab is for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquiry" /> only. The figures in it are calculated from the Cost Flow Detail tab figures and the payment profile percentages defined against each detailed cash flow section.  </p>
        <p class="Body">The detailed cash flow will be updated from the Cost Flow Detail whenever the <span class="Function">Recalculate Finance</span> or <span class="Function">Recalculate Finance and ROCE</span> functions are run.  It will also be updated during the <span class="Function">Update Appraisal with Actuals</span> process (see <MadCap:xref href="Update Appraisal with Actuals.htm">1, <i>Update Appraisal with Actuals</i></MadCap:xref>).</p>
