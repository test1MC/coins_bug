        <p class="Body" style="page-break-after: avoid;">A new Work in Progress screen is available on the appraisal. This is similar in format to the Summary Cash Flow <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Enquiry caps" /> tab but shows different figures.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">The rows are the top level template sections and the columns are periods.</p>
        <p class="Body">The figures in each cell show the cumulative cost for that template section up to and including that period (from the Cost Flow Tab) less the cumulative Cost of Sale Recoveries (as per the Plots tab or the Units tab) for that template section for units legally completed up to and including that period (as per the Sales tab).</p>
        <p class="Body">If <span class="Field">Use Profit Contingency</span> is <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed, the Profit Contingency Recovery is shown.  The recovery figure as calculated (see <MadCap:xref href="Units Tab.htm">1, <i>Units Tab and Plots Tab</i></MadCap:xref>) is included as normal in the period of legal completion (with the same sign as the other recovery figures).</p>
        <p class="Body">A second row shows the Profit Contingency Release, which takes the negative of the Profit Contingency Recovery figure for each plot in whichever of the following periods is earlier:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The same period of the year following that of the legal completion (for example if legal completion in Sept 2017 contingency is released in Sept 2018), or</li>
            <li>The period of the last legal completion on the development.</li>
        </ul>
