        <p class="Body">The <span class="Function">Update Appraisal with Actuals</span> process has been updated as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The Cost Flow Detail figures are updated with the actual costs to date, and the Remaining Costs are spread in the Cost Flow in the same way as these figures <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2017-06-21T15:25:55.9935498+01:00" MadCap:creator="Don Barwick" MadCap:initials="DJB" MadCap:comment="Does this mean the figures are updated regardless of how Cash Flow Source is set?" MadCap:editor="Don Barwick" MadCap:editDate="2017-06-21T15:26:19.2093346+01:00">were previously updated</MadCap:annotation> to the Cash Flow Detail (if the <span class="Function"><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Links Configuration</span> <span class="Field">Cash Flow Source</span> was set to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Costs).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Cash Flow Detail figures are updated with the actual cash movements to date from the Cash Profiles figures (as previously available if the <span class="Function"><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Links Configuration</span> had the <span class="Field">Cash Flow Source</span> set as Cash Profiles).  Note: <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2017-06-21T15:26:37.7742138+01:00" MadCap:creator="Don Barwick" MadCap:initials="DJB" MadCap:comment="What happens if Cash Profiles is not being used?" MadCap:editor="Don Barwick" MadCap:editDate="2017-06-21T15:26:48.9091317+01:00">this will only be done if <span class="module">Cash Profiles</span> is being used;</MadCap:annotation> this is determined by the Cash Profiles parameter <span class="parameter">CPROFILE</span>.</p>
                <p>The Cash Flow Detail figures for future months are then calculated from the Cost Flow detail figures using the Payment Profile percentages set up against each template section.</p>
                <p>The cash flow figures are adjusted to absorb any difference in the actual cash flows to date and those that would have been forecast based on the actual costs to date in the first two forecast months.</p>
