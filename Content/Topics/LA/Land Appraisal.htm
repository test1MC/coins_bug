        </h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.La Land Management caps" /> (LA) provides a single solution for the swift production of both initial and detailed land evaluations, allowing users to consider different scenarios and respond quickly to changes in planning or circumstance.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.La Land Management caps" /> is highly configurable and adaptable to the level of detail required. Users can produce appraisals using their own costing structures and preferred methods of working.</p>
        <p>In conjunction with the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> House Sales, VAP (Valuations and Automated Payments), Financials and Cash Flow and Profit Forecasting modules, land appraisals can be collated to produce a comprehensive company or group cash flow and accurate profit forecasts.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.La Land Management caps" /> supports key business processes such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quick and easy entry of “fag packet” appraisals that can be worked into more detailed appraisals as more information becomes available.</li>
            <li>Simple, flexible input defined by users to suit their business requirements.</li>
            <li>Multi-sector grouping to produce appraisals for mixed-use developments.</li>
            <li>Built-in cash flow and profit forecasting using preset or user defined formula.</li>
            <li>Automatic calculation of finance requirements.</li>
            <li>Alternative “what if” appraisals can be produced for comparison.</li>
            <li>Reporting and Key Performance Indicators.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Types of Appraisal</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.La Land Management caps" /> can be deployed to input and analyse information as various levels of detail according to your preferred configuration.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The “fag packet” appraisal allows basic unit income and cost data to be entered at the highest level of the cost structure as well as an initial land or profit value to be calculated.</li>
            <li>Land value can be back calculated from a target profit percentage.</li>
            <li>The “fag packet” can be worked into a more detailed appraisal as additional information becomes available.</li>
            <li>Changes are recorded in real time so that the significance of individual changes can be seen upon the resultant figures.</li>
            <li>Potential developments can be appraised down to individual plot level.</li>
            <li>Multiple versions of an appraisal can be held. Once a final version of the appraisal emerges it can be flagged for incorporation into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Cash Flow and Profit Forecasting.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cost Structure and System Configuration</h2>
        <p>The template for the appraisal cost structure is wholly user defined and allows you to group your income and costs in a manner that suits your business.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The user defines the headings of the elements in the cost structure.</li>
            <li>A hierarchy allows up to three levels of detail to be held.</li>
            <li>Different configurations of a template can be stored to cater for different kinds of developments.</li>
            <li>Templates can be modified to suit particular sectors within an appraisal.</li>
            <li>Sections can be linked to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Financials to enable later direct comparison between appraisal and actual costs.</li>
            <li>Where appropriate existing data from other <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> modules (such as unit types and budgets) can be used when appraising new sites.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Multi-Sector Developments</h2>
        <p>For appraisals where there are different sectors to be appraised (for example residential, housing association, commercial and so on), <MadCap:variable name="Variables.La Land Management caps" /> breaks the appraisal down into “mini appraisals” which can then be consolidated into a single appraisal and cash flow.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The sectors to be appraised are user defined and any number can be held within one appraisal.</li>
            <li>User defined cost templates for these separate sectors can be created and amended within the same appraisal.</li>
            <li>Profitability can be assessed and individual cash flows produced for each sector</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cash Flow</h2>
        <p>Appraisals can be cash flowed over the specified date range of a proposed development and each cost element can be distributed in different ways as required.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Built-in standard methods for distributing costs include allocation by build or sales schedule, front or back loaded, even spread or lump sum.</li>
            <li>User-defined methods of allocation can also be created to cater for your own cost profiles.</li>
            <li>Where spending does not conform to a pattern (for example roads and sewers), costs can be allocated manually, with the amount remaining to be allocated displayed.</li>
            <li>From the appraisal, cash flow monthly finance requirements are calculated; loan repayment, site profits and KPIs can be deduced.</li>
            <li>The appraisal cash flow provides the base data for populating a consolidated company or group cash flow in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Cash Flow and Profit Forecasting module.</li>
            <li>Multiple sources of finance enable you to spread the funding requirements between shareholders and external sources.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What Ifs</h2>
        <p>“What if” scenarios can be explored and changes to the system analysed in detail.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Income and cost data can be amended to show what happens when increased or decreased across the life of a site.</li>
            <li>The effects of changed interest or inflation rates on finance requirements and site profitability can be modelled.</li>
            <li>Different versions of the same appraisal can be monitored and compared.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Reporting and KPI Production</h2>
        <p>Reporting in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.La Land Management caps" /> is performed through the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Open Architecture reporting tool. This enables users to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Show calculations of differences between specified elements.</li>
            <li>Report on appraisals at various levels of detail.</li>
            <li>Report on business KPIs such as ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return).</li>
            <li>Produce graphical representations of appraisals.</li>
        </ul>
