        <h1>Procurement Module</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Procurement is based on a comprehensive understanding of the core business processes of winning and managing construction contracts. It supports activities throughout the procurement process: planning; defining procurement packages; selecting vendors; creating and issuing requisitions, tender appraisals, order approvals, and purchase orders; and reviewing performance. Procurement also logs deliveries and matches material and plant invoices to receipts and orders.</p>
