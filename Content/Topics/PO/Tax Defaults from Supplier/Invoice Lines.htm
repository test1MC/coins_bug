        <p class="Body">When an invoice costing line is created the sales tax code on the line is set to the sales tax code on the invoice header.</p>
        <p class="Body">If the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>PL parameter <span class="parameter">DFTAXLIN</span> is set to “H”, the sales tax code from the invoice header does not change, regardless of the costing analysis entered on the line.  The user can manually change the sales tax code on a line by line basis.</p>
        <p class="Body">If the PL&#160;parameter <span class="parameter">DFTAXLIN</span> is set to “A”, the values entered in the costing analysis (for example, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />, commodity code, WBS&#160;code, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost head" />, or cost category) can result in the analysis line being populated with a different sales tax code.</p>
