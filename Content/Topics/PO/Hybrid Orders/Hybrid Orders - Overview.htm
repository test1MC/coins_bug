        <p class="Body">It is <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">now </MadCap:conditionalText>possible to mix lump sum and quantity lines on the same order.</p>
        <p class="Body">This allows orders to cater for the situation where a buyer negotiates a lump sum price for a whole set of items.  The quantity of each item to be ordered is specified, but not necessarily the price. The quantities delivered can be monitored, but the value invoiced is processed against the lump sum amount rather than the individual item lines.  It is also possible for any of the quantified item lines to have a price and therefore have the value invoiced allocated to them.</p>
