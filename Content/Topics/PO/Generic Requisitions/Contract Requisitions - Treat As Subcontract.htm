        <p class="Body">It may be that a requisition cannot be ordered on a material or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" /> order nor fulfilled from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.st stock" />, but the request should result in the raising of a subcontract order. </p>
        <p class="Body">A new option - <span class="Function">Treat As Subcontract</span> - is available if the requisition has been issued but no orders have been raised against it. </p>
        <p class="Body">The option marks the requisition as “Closed (Treated as Subcontract)”; no further processing occurs and no orders can be placed against it. A subcontract order would have to be raised manually.</p>
        <p class="Body">Each line belonging to the requisition is also marked as “Treated as Subcontract”.</p>
        <p class="Body">An additional option - <span class="Function">Undo Treat as Subcontract</span> - is available to undo the “Treated as Subcontract” status.  </p>
        <p class="Body">These two options do not appear on the Actions menu on the Requisitions Browse screen.  This is because the decision to “Treat as Subcontract” would require that the buyer looks in detail into the requirement specified on the requisitions lines.</p>
        <p class="Body">These options are available for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Requisitions and also for all major types of requisition except subcontract (in other words, for material, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" />, overhead, workshop, asset and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.st stock" />).</p>
