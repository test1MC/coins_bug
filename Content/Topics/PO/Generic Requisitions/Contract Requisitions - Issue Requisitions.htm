        <p class="Body">When issuing a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> requisition, if a line contains a blank <span class="Field">Code</span> and no <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost head" /> and category were specified at the time of data entry, this is not treated as a costing error and the requisition can be issued.</p>
        <p class="Body">Also, if the new PO parameter <span class="parameter">ALWTYPCH</span> is set to Y (meaning that the line type on a requisition line can be changed after the requisition has been issued), it is possible to issue a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> requisition even though it may only have text lines on it. Previously, a requisition with only text lines could not be issued.</p>
