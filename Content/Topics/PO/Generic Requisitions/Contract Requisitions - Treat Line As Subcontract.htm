        <p class="Body">If an individual line cannot be ordered or fulfilled from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.st stock" /> (and only if no orders have already been raised against the line), a new action - <span class="Function">Treat as Subcontract</span> -  allows the line to be marked accordingly.  Essentially, the line is being marked as closed so both the <span class="Field">Quantity</span> and <span class="Field">Quantity Outstanding</span> are set to zero. </p>
        <p class="Body"> A new unlabelled column on the Requisition Lines screen shows the text “Treated as Subcontract”.</p>

        <p class="Body">If this action is taken in error, an additional action is available to <span class="Function">Undo Treat as Subcontract</span> (including the Quantities that were set to zero).  This action is only allowed on requisition lines that are currently marked as “Treated as Subcontract”.</p>
        <p class="Body">These two options are only available of the requisition has been issued.  </p>
        <p class="Body">These options are available for <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Jc Contract caps" /> Requisitions and also for all major types of requisition except subcontract (in other words, for material, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" />, overhead, workshop, asset and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.st stock" />).</p>
