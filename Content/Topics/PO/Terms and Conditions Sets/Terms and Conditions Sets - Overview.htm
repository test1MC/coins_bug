        <p>Terms and conditions on purchase orders are important in that they specify in detail the commercial basis of the order being raised. As an alternative to representing terms and conditions using clauses and other related text devices in the body of the order, a <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>more focused standard mechanism for accurately showing terms and conditions on purchase orders is available.</p>
        <p>The Terms and Conditions Set to be used on a purchase order is derived from the order type selected and the project that the order is raised against.  The set stored on the project overrides any set held against the order type.  The person raising the order cannot change the set that the system has chosen, but is able to amend or delete individual terms and conditions lines on an order, if they are configured to allow this.</p>
