        <p class="Body">The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> number entered on the order header screen is deemed to be the “owning” <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />; only the owning <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> is shown on the orders browse. This means that if an order relates to more than one <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />, you can only filter or search for it using the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> number entered on the order header. </p>
        <p class="Body">A single purchase order can only have one accrual method.  This accrual method is typically dictated by the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />, although it can be derived from the supplier or the order type.  Where it is the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> number that dictates the accrual method, it is the owning <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> number that determines the accrual method, rather than any other <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />, overhead department, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.st stock" /> location etc entered on order lines.  On the Order Summary screen this field is referred to as <span class="Field">Accrual Type</span>.</p>
        <p class="Body">For <MadCap:variable name="Variables.st stock" /> purchase orders to operate correctly, GRNs must be entered.  For this reason, if the accrual type stamped on the order header implies that GRNs are not required, “<MadCap:variable name="Variables.St Stock caps" /> Location” is excluded from the Analysis Type selection drop down box during order line entry.</p>
