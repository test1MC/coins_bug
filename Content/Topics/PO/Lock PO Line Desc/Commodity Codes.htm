                    <p>Whether any additional text is required when using this commodity on an order.</p>
                    <p>The options are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Default to Header Code (the rule on the header code applies; this is only available on detail commodity codes)</li>
                        <li>Not Required (the additional text box is not visible on order line entry)</li>
                        <li>Mandatory (the additional text box cannot be left blank during order line entry)</li>
                        <li>Optional (the additional text box can be left blank during order line entry)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, you may have a header code for bricks on which the <span class="field">Additional Description Rule</span> is set to Mandatory.  Typically, you may set every detail code below that head code to “Default to Header Code”.  In this way, you are minim<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ing the maintenance effort.  However, you can then visit certain detail commodity codes within that same header code and set their Rule to, say, “Optional”.</p>

                    <p>Text explaining to the user that they should enter additional information specific to the selected commodity code.  So, for example, on a commodity code that represented some sort of conduit you might set this text to “Please specify size (e.g. 10m) and finish (e.g. Steel)”.  </p>
                    <p>Note that you may not want to enter any coaching text on certain detail commodity codes because their related header code’s coaching text should suffice.  During order entry <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> display the coaching text from the header code if the selected commodity code’s coaching text is blank.</p>
