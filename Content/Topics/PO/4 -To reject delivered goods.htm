        <h1>To reject delivered goods</h1>
        <p>In some cases it is necessary to refuse delivery of items on an order – for example, the items may be damaged or an incorrect item received. It is important that this is recorded correctly to prevent issues closing the order or problems during invoice matching.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Open.flsnp" />) next to the appropriate delivery line. This will open the line for data entry. </p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Set the Quantity Delivered to the actual number of items delivered against the order.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">The quantity delivered must equal the total number of items actually delivered – including the ones that were refused. So, if 6 items were delivered and 2 returned, the quantity delivered will still be 6</p>
        <p>To record the return items, enter the value in the Quantity Rejected field and select a reason for the rejection using the Drop down field Exception Code</p>
        <p> If necessary, enter a note to explain further.</p>

        <p>The delivery line will now show the delivery and a record of the rejection in the System Comments column.</p>
        <p>To finish, click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Next_Both.flsnp" />.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">The correctly delivered items can be matched against an invoice. The rejected items will still be available on the order as an outstanding quantity and will remain on the order line to be GRN’ed at a later the date when the replacement items are delivered.</p>
