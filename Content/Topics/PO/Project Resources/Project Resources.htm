            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Project Resources</h1>
        <p>Project resources can be used as a budget and buying list: requisitions and orders for resources can be raised directly from the Resources screens.</p>
        <p>You can create the list of project resources by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Extracting resources from <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Commercial Manager caps"></MadCap:variable></span>.</li>
            <li>Importing resources using a CSV file (for example, from an estimating package.</li>
            <li>Adding and updating resources manually.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When resources are created by extracting from <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Commercial Manager caps"></MadCap:variable></span> or importing from a CSV&#160;file, any source lines that have the same type, code, and unit of quantity, and on which the first 30 characters of the description are the same, are combined as a single resource. Similarly, you will be unable to add a resource manually that has the same type, code, unit of quantity, and first 30 characters of the description.</p>
