            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Merging Project Resources</h1>
        <p>Project resources can be created when requisitions or orders are raised directly from the requisitions or orders workbenches.</p>
        <p>If the item that was requisitioned or ordered has the same commodity code, rate, unit of quantity and first 30 characters of description as an existing resource line, that resource line is updated accordingly. If the item is different, it shows as a resource on the appropriate project resources screen with the text <b>ORD</b> in the <span class="field">Via</span> column. This means that the resource has been created as part of the ordering process.</p>
        <p>Resources added as part of the ordering process may be the same as existing budget resources, but because they have been given a different description when they were requisitioned or ordered they appear as separate resource lines. In this case you can merge them with the existing budget resource.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the project resource browse, select one or more resource lines with <b>ORD</b> in the <span class="field">Via</span> column,</li>
            <li>Select one line with <b>BUD</b>&#160;in the <span class="field">Via</span> column. This is the line that the other lines will be merged into. All lines must have the same commodity code and unit of quantity.</li>
            <li>From the actions menu, choose <span class="userselect">Merge line(s) into budget lines</span>.</li>
        </ol>
