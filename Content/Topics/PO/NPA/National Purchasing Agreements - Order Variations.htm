        <p class="Body">If an order line is amended, the settings of the <span class="Field">Eligible NPA Purchase with Supplier</span>	and <span class="Field">Eligible Manufacturer</span> fields are kept the same across all versions of the order line. If the order in question is a variation order, all other related versions are not updated until the variation order is committed.  If the order in question is already committed (that is, it is being updated in order correction mode), all other related versions are updated when the line is saved.</p>
        <p class="Body">If the supplier on the order header is changed, or if an order is copied, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> reassesses the setting of the <span class="Field">Eligible NPA Purchase with Supplier</span> field on the order lines with reference to the new supplier.</p>
