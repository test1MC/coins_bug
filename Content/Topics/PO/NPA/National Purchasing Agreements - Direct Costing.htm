                    <p>The lookup displays a list of manufacturers from the Central Repository with whom you have a National Purchasing Agreement.  A manufacturer, in Central Repository terms, is company whose lists of Company Types includes the value set against the CI parameter <span class="parameter">COT-MANU</span>.  Typically, this parameter is set to “MANUF” or something similar.  Only manufacturers that also have the <span class="Field">National Purchasing Agreement</span> field <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick"></MadCap:variable>ed appear in the lookup list .</p>
