        <h1>Video Creation Guidelines</h1>
        <p>Video recording (or screen casts) are a simple thing to make, but that does not always mean that a quality product will result.</p>
        <p>The following guidelines are intended to help you in putting together a screen cast that can be used directly, or passed onto another team for further editing and inclusion in a larger suite of video training materials.</p>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Who are you creating the video for?  Consider your audience.  Will they need you to explain terminology or are they already familiar with the concepts you are demonstrating?</li>
            <li>Don’t mix teaching and selling in the same video</li>
            <li>Write a script. This is critical. It is too easy to try to talk and record “off the cuff” but this rarely works and results in’ umming’ and ‘ahhing’. Keep the points short and too the point, save long descriptions for any accompanying written material if needed.</li>
            <li>Create a story board of the video.  Plan the screens you are going to show, make sure they work and do several runs before you start recording.  Don’t make a video of you trying to correct a screen that does not work as expected.</li>
            <li>Making the video will take longer than you think – don’t leave it to the last minute.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recording Audio</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Speak slowly, clearly and follow your script.  The script is there to help you avoid rambling or speaking where un-necessary.  It also focuses you on what to do next.</li>
            <li>Talk naturally.  This will take practice if you are unused to recording yourself.  Listen to yourself pre-recorded and become comfortable hearing yourself.</li>
            <li>Record in a quiet location.  This is not so important if the audio is going to be replaced at the edit stage, but if this is the audio that will be used there must be no background noise – modern microphones are VERY sensitive(even the cheap ones).</li>
            <li>Use as good a microphone as possible, preferably one with noise-cancelling capability – don’t rely on the software to do this for you.  The headsets with boom mics are suitable for this – try to avoid using the in-built laptop mic as they are better suited for video conferencing than video recording.  Remember that the viewer may be listening on headphones so quality does matter.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recording the video</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Open with an introduction and close with a summary.</li>
            <li>Let the video do all the work.  You don’t need to describe every step as you do it, concentrate on the key aspects of the process you are demonstrating – remember the user can see what you are doing.  If it is clear that you have moved to the save button and you have clicked it, you don’t need to tell them what you have done.</li>
            <li>Turn off all reminders and pop-ups – anything that happens on the screen will be recorded.</li>
            <li>Turn off un-necessary toolbars and add-ins.  Keep the menus are simple to view as possible to avoid confusing the viewer.</li>
            <li>Control your mouse movements.  DON’T use jerky or circling movements to highlight areas on the screen.  This is very distracting to the viewer.  If highlighting is important, it can be added in post-edit.</li>
            <li>Don’t restart if you make a mistake.  Just stop speaking for 3-5 seconds and then begin where you left off.  This allows the video to be edited easily to remove the section with the error.</li>
            <li>Break a subject into smaller videos.  Don’t record anything longer than 5 minutes, break it down.</li>
            <li>If there are periods where you have to do a lot of typing or form filling, pause the recording and then start again when complete.  Alternatively, record the whole sequence but pass the video to post-editing for the section to be removed and a transition added to make the jump more professional.</li>
            <li>Watch you video before you pass it to others!</li>
        </ul>
