                        <p>Type a search query. Then click the button or press Enter to initiate a search.</p>
                        <p><span class="Field">Case-insensitive&#160;Matches</span> Search is not case-sensitive. For example, a search for the word "run" will find matches for "Run" and "run."</p>
                        <p><span class="Field">Matches with Variant Endings</span> For example, a search for the word "run" will also find matches for words such as, "runner," "running," and "runs." Since matches are not case-sensitive, the results will include topics containing matches such as, "Runner,"&#160;"Running," and "Runs."</p>
                        <p><span class="Field">Phrase Search</span>  Search for phrases by enclosing the search terms in quotation marks. This is useful when you want to restrict a search to locate terms that appear in an exact order. For example, you might want to search for a phrase such as "Smart Tiles"</p>
