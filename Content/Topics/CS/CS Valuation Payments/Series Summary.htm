            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Series Summary</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales" /> series allows you to set up the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales" /> series for the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />.</p>
        <p>A series is a sequence of valuations for a specific client, or for a particular part of the work that is valued separately. The series holds information about the party who is paying for the work, and to whom applications are made. For example, if a project consists of a building (paid for by a main client) and an access road (paid for by a local council), these would be two separate <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales" /> series. The terms and conditions for different series can be different.</p>
        <p>You can either add a new series or edit an existing one.</p>
