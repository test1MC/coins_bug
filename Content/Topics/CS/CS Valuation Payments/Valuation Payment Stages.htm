        <p>Valuation Stages allows you to set up the valuation stages (if the series is set up to use Host Valuations). Each stage allows you to record different amounts that relate to the valuation (for example, the amount you applied for, the amount you expect, the final certified amount). You can define up to five stages, of which the last one must be the 'certificate' stage (the 'Receipt' stage is fixed by the system).</p>
