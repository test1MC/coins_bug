            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Viewing and Entering VPS</h1>
        <p>This allows you to keep track of the different stages of a valuation cycle, from application to payment.</p>
        <p>You can record the different values for each stage (for example, the amount you apply for, what you expect to get, the final certified amount). The stages are configurable. </p>
        <p>It is a known behaviour that an additional application is made before the first application has been fully processed.&#160; In addition the certified amount will vary from applied or expected amounts.&#160; VPS does no financial posting until the penultimate stage is reached – usually certified/invoiced.</p>
        <p>However data gathered prior to this stage can be used in various ways e.g. in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVRs" /> and Cash-flow reporting.</p>
