        <p>If you enter a certificate (or combined application and certificate) for a series that is marked as a ‘plot billing series’, additional tabs are available to allow you to enter the certified matrix and variation amounts.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Certificate Matrix</h2>
        <p>The Certificate Matrix tab shows a matrix of plots and billing stages. If the billing stage input method is ‘Amount’, you can enter the amount paid by the client (either the cumulative amount or the amount for this certificate). When you update a matrix amount, the certificate line associated with the billing stage is updated, and any dependent lines in the certificate definition are recalculated.</p>
        <p>The cell selector allows you to display different values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cumulative (updateable) - the cumulative amounts certified. </li>
            <li>This Certificate (updateable) - the amounts certified on this certificate.</li>
            <li>Order value (read-only) - the order value agreed with the client.</li>
            <li>Uncertified (read-only) - the remaining balance that is to be certified.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A tooltip on each cell shows:</p>
        <ul class="CompactList">
            <li>Order amount</li>
            <li>Previously Applied</li>
            <li>Previously Certified</li>
            <li>Balance to Apply For</li>
