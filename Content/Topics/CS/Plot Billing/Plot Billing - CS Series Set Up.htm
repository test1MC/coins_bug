        <p>If the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>VAP parameter <span class="parameter">BILLVAP</span> is set to Y, the setup of a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Contract Sales" /> series includes functionality to enable the billing of home builders and housing associations, including the ability to set up the stages, plots and amounts that are to be billed, and to cater for variations. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>To set up the series so that it uses plot-based billing, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the new <span class="field">VAP Plot Billing Series</span> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box. (The <span class="field">Input Method</span> is automatically set to Applications/Certificates.)</li>
            <li>If the new VAP parameter <span class="parameter">BILLVAL</span> is set to Y, you can also indicate that applications and certificates can be generated using the new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> group valuation Generate Billing process. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Tick caps" /> the <span class="Field">Tick Group Valuation Generation</span> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you save the series, if a default set of standard billing stages has been configured (either for the specific customer account or for the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" />), these are copied to the series billing stages. </p>
        <p>You can also use the <span class="function">Copy Standard Stages</span> Option to copy to the series any of the standard billing stages that have been configured for the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.kco company" /> or the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.sl customer" />.</p>

            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.ScreenOnly">Tabs </MadCap:conditionalText>allow you to set up the billing stages, enter variations, and enter order values on a matrix.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Billing Stages</h2>
        <p style="page-break-after: avoid;">The <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>Billing Stages tab allows you to configure the billing stages for the series.</p>

        </p>
        <p>For each billing stage, you can enter:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost head" /> associated with the billing stage, and the payment stage number within the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cost head" />. These are optional, but allow the amount to be billed to be included in <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CVRs" />, reporting etc, and also for consolidated reporting across <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contracts" /> where different clients may have a different stage breakdown.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> group(s) linked to the billing stage, if billing is being generated from tick sheet valuations. These determine the stages to be billed when generating applications or certificates from the valuation matrix.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The billing type for the stage, which determines the input method and application or certificate line that will be populated with the value from the matrix.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.2 ">Variations</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>Variations tab allows you to set up and record variations for the series. For variations that cover multiple plots, you should use a designated general plot. The combination of plot and billing stage determine which matrix element is populated with the variation amount.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/Contract Sales/Plot Billing/CS Series - Variations.png" class="FullWidth" />

            <li>Date the variation was agreed. When adding a new variation, this defaults to today’s date.</li>
            <li>The billing stage for the variation. This is a drop down of the variation billing stages configured on the new series staging tab.</li>
            <li>The plot number for the variation. </li>
            <li>Description of the variation. </li>
            <li>An optional external reference. This allows you to record any client reference for the variation.</li>
            <li>The agreed order value for the work.</li>
            <li>The cumulative amount applied for. This will be read-only.</li>
            <li>The cumulative amount certified by the client. This will be read-only.</li>
            <li>A text editor allows you to enter any notes for the variation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clicking the Detail button opens a desktop frame that lists the transactions (applications and/or certificates) entered against the variation.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.3 ">Matrix</h2>
        <p>The <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText>Matrix tab allows you to enter, for each plot and billing stage, the agreed order amount that the client is to be billed. </p>

        </p>
        <p>A tooltip on each cell shows the applied and certified amounts, and also any disputed amount.</p>
        <p>You can use the selector to display different amounts in the cells:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The agreed order value for the client. This is the only cell value you can update.</li>
            <li>The amount applied for.</li>
            <li>The certified amount.</li>
            <li>The disputed amount.</li>
            <li>Unapplied - The remaining balance that is to be applied for.</li>
            <li>Uncertified - The remaining balance that is to be certified.</li>
            <li>Applied Not Certified - The difference between the current applied and certified amounts.</li>
