            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Applications Using Plot Billing</h1>
        <p>If you enter an application (or combined application and certificate) for a series that is marked as a ‘plot billing series’, additional tabs are available to allow you to enter the matrix and variation amounts for the application.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1.1 ">Application Matrix</h2>
        <p>The Application Matrix tab shows a matrix of plots and billing stages. If the billing stage input method is ‘Amount’, you can enter the amount applied for from the client (either the cumulative amount or the amount for this application). </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_A-C/Contract Sales/Plot Billing/Application Matrix.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>When you update a matrix amount, the application line associated with the billing stage is updated, and any dependent lines in the application definition are recalculated.</p>
        <p>The cell selector in the header row allows you to display different values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cumulative (updateable) - the cumulative amounts applied for. </li>
            <li>This Application (updateable) - the amounts applied for on this application.</li>
            <li>Order value (read-only) - the order value agreed with the client.</li>
            <li>Unapplied (read-only) - the remaining balance that is to be applied for.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A tooltip on each cell shows:</p>
        <ul class="CompactList">
            <li>Order amount</li>
            <li>Previously Applied</li>
            <li>Previously Certified</li>
            <li>Balance to Apply For</li>
