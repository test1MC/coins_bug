            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Delete an Invoice </h1>
        <p>If an invoice has not yet been posted, it can be deleted from the batch, e.g. if the invoice has already been added to a batch, however the customer cancels their order and therefore the invoice does not need to be posted. </p>
        <p>From the Sales Ledger module select the Input submenu and select Invoice and Credit Note Entry. </p>
        <p> Locate the batch where the invoice is listed. Use the hyperlink in the Batch No. column to enter the batch invoices. </p>

        <p>Select the Invoices tab. Locate the invoice to be deleted and select the Tick Box adjacent to the invoice details. Click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Delete_Both.flsnp" />. </p>

        <p>The Invoices tab will be displayed.  Click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Next_Both.flsnp" /> to return to the batch listing. </p>
        <p class="note">If an invoice has been posted you cannot delete it. A credit note should be raised for the full amount of the original invoice. </p>
        <p>You can now post the batch. </p>
