            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Repeat Invoice Template</h1>
        <p>When you have saved the initial setup details, the next stage of the Repeat Invoices is displayed.</p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SL/Repeat Invoices/Repeat Invoice Template.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the Invoice Tab.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SL/Repeat Invoices/Repeat Invoice Template_1.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Click <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SL/Repeat Invoices/Repeat Invoice Template_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 52px;height: 25px;" /> to setup up the template details.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SL/Repeat Invoices/Repeat Invoice Template_3.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Since you are setting up a repeat invoice template, remember to enter more general descriptions in the Customer Reference and Description field of the Invoice tab.</p>
        <p>Please note to leave the checkbox next to the multiple lines ticked and NOT to enter the Net Amount under the Invoice tab. You will enter the invoice amount under the Lines tab that will appear after you select the save button on this screen.</p>
        <p>For more detailed instructions on entering invoices see the guide HOW TO…Enter Sales Ledger Invoices and Credit Notes.</p>
        <p>Click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Save_Both.flsnp" />to store the template header details.&#160; Additional Tabs will then be made available.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SL/Repeat Invoices/Repeat Invoice Template_4.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the lines Tab.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SL/Repeat Invoices/Repeat Invoice Template_5.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Click <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Add_Both.flsnp" /> to begin adding lines to the invoice. Again remember, whatever you enter will appear on all the generated repeat invoices created from this template. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Note the line that opens in the repeat invoice template is somewhat different from the one in standard Invoice entry. Here you need to enter the Analysis and the VAT Code (the required fields) for each entered line, even if the entered value is 0 </p>
        <p>Enter the Description, the Quantity, and the Price.&#160; You may select the Unit and the VAT Code from the dropdown menus. </p>
        <p>Enter the Analysis. If you have entered the contract number under the main details in the Invoice tab, the contract part of the analysis will be automatically populated. Contract number needs to be followed by a full stop ‘.’ and then the cost code. </p>
        <p>For example: 10000.B1234</p>
        <p>To save the entries, click <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SL/Repeat Invoices/Repeat Invoices Setup_11.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 50px;height: 23px;" />located at the beginning of the line and continue to the next line, always entering the VAT Code and the Analysis.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>The Revenue Distribution Tab</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When you have entered all the lines, select the Revenue Distribution tab. If you have entered lines with zero values, you should have at least two entries : one where the Amount is 0, and one or more with real values in the Amount column.</p>
        <p>To prevent the 0 appearing on various reports, it is important you delete that line from the repeat invoice template.&#160; You do that by ticking the box (<img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SL/Repeat Invoices/Repeat Invoice Template_8.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 20px;height: 20px;" />) at the beginning of the line with the 0.00 amount and selecting the Delete button (<img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SL/Repeat Invoices/Repeat Invoice Template_9.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 20px;height: 20px;" />).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SL/Repeat Invoices/Repeat Invoice Template_10.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>The basic setup of the recurring invoice template is now complete, so you select the Next button  at the bottom of the page to save the invoice template.</p>
        <p>Review the invoice template and when you are confident all the details are entered correctly, return to the Main tab of the Repeat Invoice template. Tick the Active box, to activate the generation of the repeat invoices and select the Save button </p>
        <p>You can un-<MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> and deactivate the template at any time to stop the generation of the repeat invoices. Just select the Open button in front of the appropriate repeat invoice template on the Repeat Invoice Workbench screen. </p>
