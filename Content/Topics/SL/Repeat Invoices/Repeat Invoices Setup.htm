                        <p>e.g. If the field is set to Total, the frequency to monthly, the time period (the start and the end date) of the repeat invoice is twelve months and you enter the value of the invoice as 12.000, this option will each month generate an invoice for 1.000.</p>
                        <p>Rate: <br />The Invoice Amount of Repeat Invoice Template will be invoiced each selected period. Use the Rate and when setting up the template enter the invoicing amount as it should be on each invoice. Rate is the more commonly used selection, since it also allows you to easily change the invoicing amount.</p>
