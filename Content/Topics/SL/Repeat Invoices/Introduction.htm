        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Repeat Invoices feature enables the automatic repeated generation of Sales Ledger invoices from an invoice template. </p>
        <p>The Frequency (how often does an invoice get raised) of repeated invoices can be monthly, quarterly, annually, bi-annually, but there is no reason that it could not be used every week, fortnight or every day.</p>
