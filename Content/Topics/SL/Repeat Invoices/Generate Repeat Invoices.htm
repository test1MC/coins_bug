            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Generate Repeat Invoices</h1>
        <p>To actually create an invoice from its template, go to the Sales Ledger Reports folder menu and select Generate Repeat Invoices.<br />This presents you with many selection options, everything from customer and contract selection, down to department selection.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SL/Repeat Invoices/Generate Repeat Invoices_1.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the End Date, the date up to which the invoices should be generated, and the Invoice Date (usually the same), the date to be assigned as the invoice date to the generated invoices. </p>
        <p>Select the correct <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Financial Date caps" /> from the dropdown menu. The financial date should be the month the invoices are raised for.</p>
        <p>Decide on the generate options: </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">None – by not selecting any of the above options, you will get a non-post/preview report, where you can review the invoices, without actually generating or posting them. </li>
            <p style="list-style-type: disc;">Generate Invoices – Tick when you want to generate invoices. </p>
            <p style="list-style-type: disc;">Post Invoices – In most cases, you will need to edit the invoice(s) once generated, so you would leave this <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> box empty.</p>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Notify Owner – Whether to notify repeat invoice owner(s) by email that the invoice(s) have been generated.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Invoiced In Advance – Whether the invoice is generated in arrears or in advance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click the Next button to generate the report / invoices, dependent on your selection.</p>
        <p>If you have not chosen the Foreground output option as the output type for your report go to the Report Status where you can select to view the report as a PDF or as an Excel spread sheet. </p>
