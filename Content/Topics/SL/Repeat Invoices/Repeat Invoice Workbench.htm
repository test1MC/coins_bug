        </p>
        <p>Make sure the Filter is set to All Invoices to ensure you can see all of the already setup repeat invoices templates. Use the Search option to find the one you are looking for. When you select a new filtering or search option, click the Apply Filter button to apply the changes to the screen.</p>
        <p>By clicking on the underlined repeat invoice number (RINVxxxxxx) in the Invoice column you can view the individual repeat invoice template, edit it (the Invoice tab) and review the invoicing to date (the Actual Invoices tab with links to the Invoice Details information).</p>

        </p>
        <p>You can only edit certain information under the Invoice tab. Use the Open button (<img src="../../../Resources/Images_S-U/SL/Repeat Invoices/Repeat Invoice Workbench_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 22px;height: 18px;" />) to open and change information. Go to the Lines tab to change the Net Amount and/or the invoice text and to the Revenue Distribution tab to edit the distribution.</p>
        <p>Note any changes you make Repeat Invoice Workbench are changes you make to the Repeat Invoice template and will affect all the invoices generated from this template from that moment on. </p>
