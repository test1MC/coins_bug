        <p class="Body">Due to legislative changes in many states, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA users are beginning to offer more Anniversary Based Accrual Plans, and they are tracking these plans and balances in OA. Previously, the Anniversary Accrual Plans in OA always used the later of the Rehire Date or the Hire Date when determining a person’s anniversary date for accruals. Since this was becoming an issue for users with hire/rehire history implementing Anniversary Based Accruals, <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">changes have been made in OA so that</MadCap:conditionalText> you can now use <span class="Field">Anniversary Month</span> and <span class="Field">Anniversary Day</span> fields to specify the anniversary date for each employee.</p>
        <p class="Body">The changes <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">described in this document </MadCap:conditionalText>apply to the US region only.</p>
