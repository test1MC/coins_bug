            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />HR Competence - Complete Management</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Competencies can be used to effectively manage the complete skills sets, requirements, and development paths of employees. In the example on the next page Joe Bloggs has 5 competencies representing over 20 linked training courses, assessments and qualifications.</p>
        <p>His competencies have been set-up to take account of:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Competence to denote entire job role</b> – This competence could have many elements linked to it that defines the job role itself. It could wrap up all the various parts and skills of the role including continual assessments etc.</p>
        <p><b>Competence to denote Health and Safety</b> – This competence specifically covers the mandatory safety requirements of the job role. Separating it in this way is useful for reporting and tracking – new safety training courses (or even toolbox talks defined as a course) could just be added to the competence as a new element.</p>
        <p><b>Competence to denote Specific Skills</b> – Of course <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can work effectively by simply being interrogated for training course types the individual has sat. However it may be useful to modulise skill sets into sub competencies (from the main job role competency). This is useful where you have an agile multi-skilled workforce that may not always be defined by a clear job role. Specific skill sets can easily work alongside overall job role competencies as the same elements can be used for other competencies. For example a competence may exist for ‘Driver’ which is linked to a training course ‘Driver’. Another competency could also exist for ‘Advanced Driver’ which also links the same ‘Driver’ Training course but also adds an ‘assessment’ called ‘Advanced Driver Assessment’.</p>
        <p><b>Competence to denote Experience</b> – Mentoring or experience can be defined as assessments which are then linked to competencies. Competencies can then be applied as part of a development path for the employee.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There is no limit to how many competencies can be applied to a Job Title or an individual</p>
