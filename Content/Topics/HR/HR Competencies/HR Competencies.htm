        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Competencies are a way of defining a Job role, either in its entirety or by its constituent requirements. </p>
        <p class="Example">For example : A Builder may need competencies in Bricklaying, Foundations, Dumper Truck Driving and Cement Mixing. These competencies are required of the Builder before he is allowed to do the work.</p>
        <p>There could be individual competencies for each skill (Cement Mixing etc.) plus a further competency called ‘Builder’ which forms all of these skill sets. This flexibility allows <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to identify who has specific skills and who has an overall profile ability.</p>
        <p>A Competence is an expectation, which remains until the person has attained it. </p>
        <p class="Example">For example : If the Electrician Joe Bloggs has 15 competencies against him - but has attained only 10 of them, then <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will also flag the other 5 as being ‘required’ of him.</p>
        <p>Competencies are achieved by a number of different methods, or by ‘Elements’. </p>
        <p>Competence Elements (often referred as ‘CR Elements’) are what make up a competence and can be either, or all, of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Training courses</li>
            <li>Assessments</li>
            <li>Qualifications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
