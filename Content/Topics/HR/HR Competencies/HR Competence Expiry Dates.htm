        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>A competency usually has a ‘shelf life’ in that it has an expiry date (for example a re-certification is needed). Where a competency expires it then becomes a ‘requirement’ again for that individual to attain.</p>
        <p>Where complex CR element structures are applied, with each element having its own shelf-life, the competency checks the entire set of expiry dates and invalidates on the first expiry instance. This feature allows for grouping of training courses (or assessments etc) into a single competency that says valid or not.</p>
