            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Assigning a Competence to an Employee</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Occasionally an employee’s job expectation doesn’t always fit neatly into the competence profile of an official job title. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="Example">For example: Both Joe Bloggs and John Smith may be Drivers but Joe Bloggs is also expected to be competent in First Aid.
</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Navigate to: <b>HR Module &gt; Competence Menu &gt; Personnel

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Personnel part of the Competence menu allows you to choose an employee. It is similar to the main HR Personnel Workbench in appearance. Select the employee of choice.</p>
        <p>After selecting an employee a new screen appears with three tabs. The three tabs are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Competence Requirements</li>
            <li>Individual Amendments</li>
            <li>Elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Competence Requirement Tab</p>
        <p>This shows the current competencies defined by the job title. It shows the status of the competencies denoting when they were passed or expired.</p>
        <p>To delete a competency select it and click on the delete icon. It is then no longer applicable for that employee (but will still be applicable to other employees with the same job title).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images_G-I/HR/HR_Competence_21_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Individual Amendments Tab</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This records changes to the employee’s competencies. </p>
        <p>You can add any relevant notes by clicking on the open icon and filling in the ‘Reason’ section.</p>
        <p>This screen also allows you to add additional competencies for that individual. To do this click on the Add icon and select a competence and add a ‘Reason’ if relevant.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Elements Tab</p>
        <p>This tab shows the Elements the competency is associated with. Elements can either be a Training Course, a Qualification or an Assessment. If No element exists for the competence then it cannot be achieved.</p>
