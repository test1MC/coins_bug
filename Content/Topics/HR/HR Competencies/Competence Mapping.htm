            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Competence Mapping</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The following diagram shows the basic principles of how competencies work. They can be assigned to a job title or assigned directly to the individual.</p>
        <p>Each Competence can be defined by one (or multiple) of 3 elements, which can be a Training Course, Assessment or via a Qualification.</p>
        <p>An element, such as a Training course, can have an expiry date. So for example Joe Bloggs attends a Safety Awareness Training course that is linked to a competence. The Training course is set up (via Training Maintenance screen) to only be valid for 365 days. When Joe attends and completes his training his associated competence is only ‘valid’ for 365 days.</p>

        <h2>Simple Example </h2>
        <p>In this example Joe Bloggs is an Advanced Welder. He has a simple competence structure which is linked to a single qualification. The qualification can in turn also be achieved by a Training Course of the same name (Training Courses are linked to Qualifications via the Training Maintenance screen).</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Job role competence example</h2>
        <p>The following example shows how a competence can relate to several ‘elements’ that define the job title ‘Advanced Welder’. In addition Joe Bloggs has had a competence of First Aid directly linked to him.</p>
        <p>Joe Bloggs would not show as ‘valid’ for the Advanced Welder competence if any of the elements had not been achieved, or, if any of the elements had expired.</p>
        <p>If Joe had not achieved either the competencies of ‘Advanced Welder’ or ‘First Aid’ then his personnel details would show as him having these competencies as ‘Required’ of him.</p>
