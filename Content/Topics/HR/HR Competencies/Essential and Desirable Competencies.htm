        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>At present there is no natural method in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> to define a competency as being either essential or desirable for a job role. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> simply assumes the competency is either valid or not valid.</p>
        <p>However duplicating competencies could be done to mimic this. For example cloning ‘Driver Skill level 1’ (keeping the same ‘elements’) and calling it ‘Driver Skill level 1 DESIRABLE’ and applying as normal to employees.</p>
