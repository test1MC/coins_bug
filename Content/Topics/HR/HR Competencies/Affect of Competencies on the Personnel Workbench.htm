            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Competencies on the Personnel Workbench</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>When competencies are added to an individual (or via a job title) their training record (Development area of the employee record in Personnel Workbench) is updated. </p>
        <p>If the competence has not been met it will show as ‘required’ (where competencies are linked to Training or assessments).</p>
        <p>When the employee attains the competency the ‘required’ row disappears. If the competency expires (gone past its ‘shelf life’) then the ‘Required’ row re-appears.</p>
