            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Applying Competencies to a Person or Role</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Competencies are usually inherited by an individual because it is assigned to their ‘job title’. Competencies can be assigned to a job title and can be a mixture of skill sets or even health and safety requirements.</p>
        <p>Job titles are in turn assigned to ‘Job Groups’. This builds flexibility to duplicate job titles/roles into different Job Groups and assign to employees. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="Example">For example a different set of competencies may apply to the same job title role but in different parts of an organisation.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> also has the flexibility to apply competencies specifically to an individual, irrespective of their ‘normal’ competencies on their job title. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="Example">For example a competency may be set up for ‘Advanced First Aid’ which is not specific to any formal job role.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Alternatively an individual may have 10 competencies that normally apply to their job role – but the person is on modified duties and 3 of the 10 no longer apply - and need taking off.</p>
