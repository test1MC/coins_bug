        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The COINSadmin system provides all you need to administer a COINS Progress environment.&#160; This means that you can install and upgrade COINS automatically, without the need for a site visit from COINS.&#160; (Installation or upgrade by COINS is available as a chargeable service.)</p>
        <p>The installation of fixes is controlled, and fixes are removed when they are superseded by a new release of the software.</p>
        <p>Because the program and data files are in known locations, ongoing administration is easier.</p>
