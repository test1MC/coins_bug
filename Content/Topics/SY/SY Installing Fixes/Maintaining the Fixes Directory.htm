        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Once you install and deploy a Fix or Service Pack the files are no longer required to be held on the directory. You may wish to copy them into another directory however you may be restricted by space and storage. </p>
        <p>As you already have the Fix and Service Pack files on the local directory, you may wish to remove them from the directory, especially if you are using the “mput” option. </p>
        <p>When using the “mput” option the system looks to the directory and will install all the files with that directory, regardless of whether they have been installed the previous month. Each month when you download the Service Pack, or additional Fixe files, the list will be increasing. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">It is good practice to remove all the files that have been installed before you download new ones. </p>
