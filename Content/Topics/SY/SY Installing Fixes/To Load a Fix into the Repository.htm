            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />To Load a Fix into the Repository</h1>
        <p>Once all the files have been transferred in the right format (Binary) and in the right place (UNIX Server) we can now load them into the repository. The repository is the central holding place for all the versions. </p>
        <p>All fixes must be loaded into the repository before being loaded into the environment. </p>
        <p>Log in to the COINSadmin area and locate the Administration Main Menu screen. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/SY/SY Installing Fixes/To Locate the Version and.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the Configure COINSadmin option from the Administration Main Menu screen, using the Arrow keys. Select the Return key.</p>
        <p>The Configuration Menu screen will be displayed. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Select Load Repository option from the menu using the Arrow keys. Select the Return key. The Load Release Archive Menu screen will be displayed. </p>

        </p>
        <p>From here the process is different for loading a single file into the repository or loading multiple files. </p>
        <h2>Loading a Single Fix File or Service Pack into the Repository</h2>
        <p>To load a single Fix File or Service Pack from the Load Release Archive menu screen.</p>
        <p>Select the Load CUI Fixes into Repository option from the menu using the Arrow keys. Select the Return key.</p>

        <p>The field will change to a no-input field (greyed out). A message prompt is displayed at the bottom of the screen “Load Fixes”.&#160; </p>
        <p>It is a good discipline to check that you have entered the right path and file name that you wish to load to the repository.</p>
