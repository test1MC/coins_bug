        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Fix Comparison Report enables you to compare the fixes installed on two environments on the same <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Server. (This is similar to the Compare Documents on two word documents to see if there are any differences, i.e. a fix that has not been installed etc. This would go into the trainer’s notes and not in here)</p>
        <p>The best example to use would be when you are applying the fixes to the Live Environment. It will ensure that the Live Environment has all the same fixes installed and deployed as the environment you have tested the fixes in. </p>
        <p>Log in to the COINSadmin area and locate the Administration Main Menu screen. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/SY/SY Installing Fixes/Fix Comparison Report.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the Configure COINSadmin option from the Administration Main Menu screen using the Arrow keys. Select the Return key. The Configuration Menu screen will be displayed.</p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/SY/SY Installing Fixes/Fix Comparison Report_1.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the Fix Comparison Report option using the Arrow keys. Select the Return key. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/SY/SY Installing Fixes/Fix Comparison Report_2.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Admin screen will be displayed. Enter the two environments you are comparing. In this example we are using learn and cplive. Select the Return key.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/SY/SY Installing Fixes/Fix Comparison Report_3.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>The Compare Environment Fixes Report is displayed. You can see that two fixes have been installed and deployed on cplive, whilst only one has been installed on the learn environment. </p>
        <p>You will now be required to trim the webspeed agents. </p>
