            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Installing a Fix</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Install Fix option allows you to install fixes that have been sent to your site by <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> or downloaded by you from the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> website. It is therefore crucial that you have the version of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> that you are using.</p>
        <p> Each fix has a unique number. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> supply fixes in the form of “Fix File or Service Packs” which can contain one or more fixes.&#160; </p>
        <p>Deploying any fix causes a recompile of all necessary fixes installed and the relevant time should be allocated accordingly. All Service Packs are compiled and based on you having already installed the previous ones. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <div>
            <p class="note">It is a requirement that all fixes are deployed and tested in a NON-Live environment before deploying to a Live environment.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Installing any fix to the Live environment should be performed when all users are logged out of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> or at a quiet period, i.e. out of office hours (See Delayed Fixes) </p>
        </div>
        <p>The Fix File or Service Packs are simply tar archives and have a standard naming format, i.e. coins_version-fix_number.tar. In our example V1022 = <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Version Number, 63365 = Fix Number and .tar = the file type.&#160; </p>
        <p>Installing a fix is a two-stage process</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Loading the fix into the software repository.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Deploying the fix.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, you can do these at different times. You can load several fixes, and install them later.</p>
