            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />To Locate the Version and Environment</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There are various ways to find the details of the version number of your current environment and you may feel comfortable using one of these methods. </p>
        <p>However we are going to use the Configuration Report to find this information and to do this you are required to log into COINSadmin. </p>
        <p>Select the Configure COINSadmin option from the Administration Main Menu screen, using the Arrow keys. Select the Return key.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/SY/SY Installing Fixes/To Locate the Version and.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>This will display the Configuration Menu screen. Select the Configuration Report option using the Arrow keys. Select the Return key.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/SY/SY Installing Fixes/To Locate the Version and_1.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>The Configuration Report is displayed detailing information regarding the environments and the versions. </p>
        <p>Use the Page Up and Page Down keys to scroll through the report. The Repository will show information of the versions currently loaded. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/SY/SY Installing Fixes/To Locate the Version and_2.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>By scrolling further down the report you will locate the environment that you require. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/SY/SY Installing Fixes/To Locate the Version and_3.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>This will also confirm the version number of the environment that you wish to load fixes in. In our example you can see that the Learn Environment is on V10.22 (101102 – is the latest release). </p>
        <p>Select the F4 key to return to the Configuration Menu screen. </p>
