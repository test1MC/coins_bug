        <p>All fixes are installed on the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> server. When you are installing a Fix or Service Pack you will be required to download these onto a local directory. This can be your C:\ drive and you are recommended to create a Folder called Fixes on the C:\ drive. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/SY/SY Installing Fixes/Download the Fix.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>This will enable you to always locate the files once they have been downloaded from the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> website or from an email attachment direct from Support Desk.  </p>
        <p>The Client Area on the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Website shows a list of all the fixes and service patches available. This is a secure area and you will need to have an allocated User Id and sign on to access this area. </p>
        <p>From the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> website&#160; <a href="http://www.coins-global.com"><span class="Hyperlink">www.coins-global.com</span></a> select the Client Area from the Tool Bar. Enter your User Id and your password in the relevant fields. Select the Sign In button. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Fixes are released throughout the month. Any Service Packs will always include the Fixes released the previous month and any additional Fixes required to be installed. You must always install the previous Service Packs before you deploy any fixes for the current month. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The Fixes are graded using a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.colour" /> code, Red = Urgent, should be deployed as soon as possible, Amber = Important Non Urgent, to be deployed during the month and Green = Can be deployed during the month or in the month end Service Pack. Service Packs are always Red as these should always be installed. </p>
        <p>The details of each Fix or Service Pack are listed in a table format and the headings are defined below </p>

        <p>The Save As screen will be displayed to enable you to save the Fix File or Service Pack. In our example we are saving the file on the C:\drive under a specific folder called Fixes.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The Fix File or Service Packs are tar archives and have a standard naming format, i.e. coins_version-fix_number.tar. In our example V1022 = <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Version Number, 63365 = Fix/Pack Number and .tar = the file type.&#160; </p>

        </p>
        <p>Select the Close button and you will return to the Fix Table to download the next one you require. </p>
        <p>Once all the Fix or Service Pack downloads are complete you are required to transfer these to the server and ensure they are in the correct format. </p>
        <p>We recommend that you create another folder or sub folder called “Archived” or “Installed”. When all the latest Fixes and Service Packs have been installed and complete, move all the Fix Files and Service Packs to the Archived/Installed folder.&#160;&#160; </p>
        <p>Only the current Fix files and Service Packs that are waiting to be installed should be in the Fixes folder. </p>
