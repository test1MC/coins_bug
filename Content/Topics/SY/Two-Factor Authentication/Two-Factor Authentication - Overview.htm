        <p class="Body">There is <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">a new </MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.ScreenOnly">an </MadCap:conditionalText>optional feature to require users to authenticate with a normal user ID and password but also with a second method which involves a time-limited passcode that is sent  to the user via SMS or email.</p>
        <p class="Body">This greatly enhances the authentication of users in to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> and is particularly relevant if the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> system is available on the public Internet.</p>
        <p class="Body">The existing authentication methods are preserved.  If using LDAP then the user ID password authentication will continue to be with LDAP.  If using <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> authentication then the user ID and password will be checked with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p class="Body">The extra authentication is intended to be used with the <MadCap:xref href="../Remember User ID/Overview.htm">Remember User ID – Overview</MadCap:xref> feature introduced in v11.05.  This allows a user’s authentication to be stored securely in private data in the browser so that they need to authenticate with user ID and password (and now with passcode) less frequently than each time they access <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p class="Body">The password hashing algorithms have also been strengthened.</p>
