            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Overview of Multi-Currency  </h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> provides the facility to operate with multiple currencies, for transaction processing and reporting. Multi-currency usage requires configuring the system to use these different currencies, and gives further options to use this in reports.</p>
        <p>The key elements of Multi Currency are:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>A "Base" currency, which can be different for each <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> company, and which by default that company operates in.</li>
            <li>Exchange rates maintained by the user.</li>
            <li>The ability to specify different currencies on different accounts (suppliers, customers, contracts, bank accounts etc), and have different currency values calculated as transactions are input or processed, generally known as "Foreign Currency".</li>
            <li>The conversion of any foreign currency values at point of input into "Base" currency, which allows standardised reporting throughout the system.</li>
            <li>Calculation of potential exchange differences, as a provision, when currency rates change and transactions are still held in the system (unrealised variance).</li>
            <li>Specific processing of currency aspects such as actual exchange variances at point of payment, and the costing of these.</li>
            <li>The ability to produce financial reports in a range of different currencies, generally known as "Alternative Base Currency".</li>
            <li>Standard reports throughout the system able to be run in a range of currencies.&#160; For example supplier reports can be run in the account currency or all suppliers can be reported in the base currency, or one of the alternative base currencies.</li>
            <li>Detailed provision for aspects of foreign currency contracting, such as client billing in a different currency to the contract cost/revenue reporting currency; multiple clients on the same contract, each working in a different currency, etc.</li>
            <li>Production of consolidated Balance Sheets and other financial reports across companies, which merge different companies working in different base currencies.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is usually delivered with company 1 as a multi-currency company, but if you have an earlier implementation, you may have company 1 set up as single currency (that is, the currency field is blank).&#160; In this case you will need to define the base currency before you can process multi-currency transactions.&#160; Also, any new companies you create on the system will have the base currency blank initially and will need to have the base currency set.</p>
        <p>WARNING:&#160; If you have any doubts about the currency set up process, we recommend you run through the procedures in a "copy of live" system, and/or request assistance from a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> consultant, before performing the process on your main system.</p>
