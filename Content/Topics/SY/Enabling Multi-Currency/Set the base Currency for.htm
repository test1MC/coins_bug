            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Set the base Currency for the Company</h1>
        <p class="note">To set the currency you MUST be logged in to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> as SYSAdmin rather than your normal user login.&#160; This ensures that only the system administrator is able to set the base currency for a company.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 72pt;" start="1">
            <li>Ensure that no other users are accessing the company during this process.</li>
            <li>Change to the company you want to set up.</li>
            <li>Go to System &gt; Company Setup &gt; Configuration &gt; Set Currency.</li>
            <li>Enter the code for the base currency of the company - this is the currency that the company will work in.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you are converting an existing single-currency company, and there are already transactions on the system, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> sets all transactions and supplier and customer records to the base currency. This may take several minutes.&#160; The process works through every account and every transaction present on the company and calculates the various currency fields required.</p>
        <p>Before entering any transactions the Currency will need to be set on the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> company. Each company has a base currency and can also have an alternate base.  You need to configure each <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> company separately.  You can have some <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> companies using multi-currency and some using single currency operation (although if you do, you will not be able to do General Ledger cross-company consolidation). </p>
