        <p>To Note:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">You cannot change the currency on a Contract once any codes etc have been set up or any costs , commitments or accruals have been recorded on the contract . This also includes inputting Budgets.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If you have incorrectly set up a currency on a contract this can be undone providing NO costs have been incurred.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">You can set up the Base currency on the contract then record orders and transactions in the foreign currency, the system will adjust the amount for reporting according to the set up of the currency exchange rates.</li>
