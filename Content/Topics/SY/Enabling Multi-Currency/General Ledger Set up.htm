        <p>Set up the General Ledger account codes for the exchange gains and losses account, unrealised variance account and rounding account.</p>
        <p>The Exchange Variance GL account is used when a foreign currency invoice is paid, the foreign exchange rate has changed since entry, and the amount paid in foreign currency now represents a different value in Base currency. It should be a P&amp;L account.</p>
        <p>The Unrealised Variance GL account is used by the Unrealised Variance reports, typically run at the end of each month, to calculate the potential difference if the exchange rate on invoices still on the ledger has moved since they were input. It should be a Balance Sheet account. The opposite side of the GL journal optionally generated by this report is to the relevant ledger control account.</p>
        <p>The Rounding GL account is required for any miscellaneous residual amounts that arise from currency conversion. It should be a P&amp;L account. These amounts are automatically posted there by the various posting programs. Any transaction values should normally be no more than 0.01 or 0.02 for each transaction processed, and there should not be many transactions overall. If there are a significant number of transactions it is an indication that foreign exchange rates are not being entered to an appropriate level of precision. Rates up to 6 decimal places are allowed for. If transactions of substantial value are in this account it is an indication of a configuration error, which should be traced back and the system reconfigured as required to overcome it.</p>
