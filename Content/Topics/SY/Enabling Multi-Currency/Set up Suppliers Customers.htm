            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Set up Suppliers, Customers </h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>By default, when you set up an account for a new supplier, customer or subcontractor, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will assign the <span class="Hyperlink">base currency</span> to that account. </p>
        <p>When you set up a new account from the Company Information Workbench and link the Office to an account already existing in the Purchase(Supplier)&#160; Ledger , <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> assigns the account currency according to the set up on the office in the PL of the company that you select. </p>
        <p>To set up the office: </p>
        <p>1. Go to Company Information Workbench. </p>
        <p>2. Select the company. </p>
        <p>3. Select the Offices TAB and add a New Office. </p>
        <p>4. Leave the Company Information Workbench and go to Supplier Maintenance in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" />. </p>
        <p>5. Set up a new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> or Sales Ledger account. The details should be the same as on the old account, except that the Currency code should be set to the new currency. </p>
        <p>If you make a mistake with the currency code, you can go back and change it provided that you have not yet entered an invoice against the supplier. Once you have entered an invoice, you cannot change the currency code on the account.</p>
        <p>7. In the Company Information Workbench the Office will now be stamped with the Account number and the&#160; PL Currency Code, SL Currency Code and SC Currency Code fields will display the currency. If the company does not yet exist in the Sub-ledger the currency will not be displayed.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>6. Then set up the account in the ledger in the usual way. </p>
        <p>If the account already exists in the ledger of any <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> company, the currency code you set up on the office must match the currency of the account – <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will not let you enter a different one. This also means that on accounts with the same number in different <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> companies, the currency code must be the same. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Base currency </p>
        <p>The currency that the (current) company works in. Different <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> companies can have different base currencies. </p>
        <p>Foreign currency </p>
        <p>A currency other than the base currency of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> company you are working in </p>
        <p>Document currency </p>
        <p>The currency in which the transaction is entered. </p>
