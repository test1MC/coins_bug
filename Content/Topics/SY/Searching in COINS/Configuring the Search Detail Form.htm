            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Configuring the Search Detail Form</h1>
        <p class="Body">Desktop global search includes a small details page for each record.  The standard naming for these is %WSYD&lt;TLA&gt;. For example, the detail page for ap_invoice has the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Function: %WSYDAIN</li>
            <li>Page: %WSYDAIN – this is a  page with Detail form only</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">If you want to provide a detail form for a record that is not already available, or want to show different details, create the appropriate function and page, or copy and modify an existing one. It is best practice to show all fields that are indexed. Child records can be shown using a field with View As set to List Frame that points to a browse page.</p>
        <p class="Body">Enter the code for the detail form in the Detail field of the configuration record (see <MadCap:xref href="Global Search Configuration - Tables.htm">Global Search Configuration Records</MadCap:xref>).</p>
