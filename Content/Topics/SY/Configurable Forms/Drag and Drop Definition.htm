            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Drag and Drop Designer</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> v11.02 introduced a drag and drop interface for defining the definition of fields on a Document.</p>
        <p>Once the initial definition of the Document Type has been completed (<MadCap:xref href="../../WD/WDSY0502_Creating_Documents.html">Creating a New Document</MadCap:xref>), select the Designer Link at the top of the screen.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Drag and Drop Definition.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>The drag and drop designer interface will be displayed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Drag and Drop Definition_1.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>The interface window is split into three main sections.</p>
        <p>

            <br />The left hand pane contains the Document Layout Properties, split between the Document Layout Tree, which shows the document sections and the View Properties panel.</p>
        <p>The View Properties can be shown or hidden by clicking the Triangle icon on the top right hand side.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The central pane shows the main document canvas, also split into sections and rows.&#160; </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Drag and Drop Definition_4.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>This is the area in which you will define the document content in a WYSIWYG format.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Drag and Drop Definition_5.png" style="left: 0;" class="HalfWidth" />
            <br />The third pane is the properties panel.&#160; When a field is selected, this panel will give access to most of the properties that would be available when defining a field through manual entry as detailed previously in this documentation.</p>
