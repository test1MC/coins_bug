            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Defining Content using Drag and Drop</h1>

            <br />In the Layout Tree, expand the section to be worked on.&#160; Initially one row will be available in each section.&#160; Rows must exist before content can be added to them.&#160; Rows can be added or deleted by right clicking on an existing row to display the options menu.</p>
        <p>Create the number of rows required and these will appear in the Layout Tree and the Canvas.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Drag and Drop Definition_7.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Rows may contain text, database fields, images and Sub-Forms.&#160; All of which may be selected from the options at the top of the canvas and dragged into position.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Drag and Drop Definition_8.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>With the element in place, the Layout Panel and Properties Panel will display the appropriate detail.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Drag and Drop Definition_9.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>To set the properties of the selected element, use the properties panel to set up field names, formats and calculations etc. as required by double clicking on the item to change.&#160; Note that field names (eg. job_num) must be known before-hand as field lookup is not currently available in the Drag and Drop interface.</p>
        <p>For simple changes to an element, double click on the field within the canvas to change its name or label.&#160; Widths and heights can also be changed in the canvas by dragging the borders of the field.</p>
        <p>Continue to define your document as required.</p>
        <p>To amend fields or view their properties, select the field in the Layout tree or double click the field on the canvas.</p>
        <p>To add gaps between fields, add Text fields of an appropriate width and set the text field to blank.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Drag and Drop Definition_10.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>The Undo and Re-do buttons will only undo/re-do the last change you made to the design</p>
        <p>Use the Save button at the top of the canvas periodically to save your work and commit the design to the Document Designer.&#160; Your work will be lost if you fail to do this.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Drag and Drop Definition_11.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Once you have completed your design, as in the example below:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Drag and Drop Definition_12.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Ensure that you save before closing the interface window.</p>
        <p>In Document Designer, all of the form design will appear in the fields tab for your form</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Drag and Drop Definition_13.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>You can now make any manual changes to the design or preview it using the Preview option at the top of the screen.&#160; You may return to the Drag and Drop interface at any time by clicking the Designer link at the top of the screen.</p>
