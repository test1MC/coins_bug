        <p class="Body">The SY parameter STYLEVAR will be automatically set to v1105 as part of the upgrade process. The previous style settings are available in case you need to refer back to them temporarily, but are no longer supported. </p>
        <p class="Body">You should remove existing custom style sheets (for example, user.css), as these may conflict with the new styles. If you want to make style changes that are not covered by the new <MadCap:variable name="Variables.colour" /> palettes (for example, to change the background <MadCap:variable name="Variables.colour" />), you can create a new user.css to override the standard settings in the new style sheet.</p>
        <p class="Body">Note that the SY parameters in the “Style” group are no longer used and will be removed in a future release.</p>
