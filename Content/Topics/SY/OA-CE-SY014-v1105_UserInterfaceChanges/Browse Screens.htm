        <p class="Body">In order to allow the maximum number of rows to show on browse screens, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />&#160;now calculates how much space is available and shows the appropriate number of rows for that screen. This is calculated for each screen, and for each user. The first time you go into a screen, it may show the default number of rows, but after that (or if you refresh) it will show enough rows to fit on the screen. If the amount of space changes (for example, if you resize the window or change to a different computer or monitor), the number of rows will adjust if you refresh the browse.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can now click anywhere on a row to select it. As before, you can select multiple rows using Shift+click and Ctrl+click.</p>
