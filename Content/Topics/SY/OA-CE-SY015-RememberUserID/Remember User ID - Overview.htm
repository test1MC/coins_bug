            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Overview</h1>
        <p class="Body"><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can remember the user ID of a Windows PC and allow the user to log on to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> without the need to enter a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> password. (A similar feature was previously available only for IE and required a specific IIS server.) It is assumed that appropriate Windows user authentication, screen locking etc. is in place because (as was the case with the existing IIS pass through authentication) if someone is able to access an unlocked Windows screen then they will also have access to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> for the user logged in on that PC.</p>
        <p class="Body">The user needs to periodically authenticate with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> (this can be with LDAP/Active Directory if configured) but between these authentications <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will recogn<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />e who they are let them straight in without requiring additional repeated authentication.</p>
