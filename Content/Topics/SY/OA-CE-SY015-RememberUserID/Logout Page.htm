        <p class="Body">When a user whose IP&#160;address is defined in the WEBRIPS list logs out, they are taken to the page specified by the SY parameter LOGOUT. A default page is provided, which is used if LOGOUT is blank. This default page has links to allow the user to log in to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> (which will bypass the login screen), or to allow them to log in as a different user (which will force them to log in using the login screen). </p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">We anticipate that clients will create their own "log in to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />/logout" page, for example as part of their corporate intranet, using the links on the default page as a basis.</p>
