            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Prime Groups</h1>
        <p>Each user is assigned to a prime group.&#160; In conjunction with the user's security level, this controls whether the user has access to reports and batches created by other users.&#160; You have access to another user’s reports and batches if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>That user's prime group is included in your group list, and </li>
            <li>Your security level is higher than the other user's security level (or the security levels are equal, if the SY parameter EQUACESS is set to Y).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because of this, we recommend that you have separate groups for data access (batches and reports) and for function access. </p>
