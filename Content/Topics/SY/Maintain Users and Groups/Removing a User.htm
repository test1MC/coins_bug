            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Removing a User</h1>
        <p>When you no longer want a user to have access to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> (for example, when they leave the company), you should disable their User ID.&#160; However, you should not delete their user record; <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> has the policy of retaining details of all historical users in the database for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring that the transactional audit trail retains details of who input and/or authorised transactions, orders, payment runs, etc;</li>
            <li>Ensuring that reprinted documents, including purchase orders, etc. will correctly print without missing information;</li>
            <li>Ensuring that there is referential integrity within the database where database records refer to user IDs;</li>
            <li>Preventing problems when users need to edit records which include reference to a user who has left (in some circumstances, if the details of the original user have been deleted then an error message will be displayed and the user will need to overwrite the original details with a current user): this can be both frustrating at the time and misleading for the future;</li>
            <li>Allowing access to the User Logging Enquiry to review functions used on <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> by the historical user (subject to the time limit set in SY parameter LOGHIST).</li>
        </ul>
