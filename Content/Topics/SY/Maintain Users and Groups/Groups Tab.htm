        <h2>Groups</h2>
        <p>Each user belongs to one or more groups. By default, users in the same group have access to the same subset of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> menus and procedures. However, you can grant or deny individuals within a group access to different menus and procedures; they do not need to be restricted to the access permissions for the group.</p>
        <p>Select the group you want to assign to the user from the Available field and use the green arrows to move the group(s) to the Selected Field.&#160; Red Arrows allow you to deselect groups from the selected field:</p>

        <h2>Roles</h2>
        <p>Many users will use only a few <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> functions and, maybe, only occasionally. Role-based licensing provides a cost-effective way of giving access for large numbers of users to small but important parts of <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.  Role-based licensing uses the concept of "named role" users; these do not count as regular concurrent licensed users.  Your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" /> determines the number of "named role" users you can have.</p>
        <p>Roles are pre-defined by Construction Industry Solutions, and issued as part of standard data.  Each role has a limited number of functions that it provides access to.  Each "named role" user can be assigned to one or more roles (thus giving them access to one or more groups of functions); they will only be allowed to run the functions associated with those roles.  You must give them access (using standard function access) to the top-level module menu for any functions they will need to run (for example, %WPL for any <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> functions), but <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> automatically gives access to any submenus needed.  You can use standard function access to prevent "named role" users from accessing specific functions within the role; however, you cannot grant them access to additional functions outside their role.</p>
        <p class="note">Named role users always have access to basic lookups, some system functions such as Home &gt; Report Status and Home &gt; Activity Workbench, and the documentation.  See Access to Mandatory Functions.</p>
        <p>You cannot change which standard (%) functions belong to a role, but you can add non-standard (that is, user-defined) functions to existing roles, up to the number allowed by your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" />.</p>
        <p>Your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="Variables.licence" /> determines the maximum number of users you can assign a role to; you will not be able to assign a role to a user if that number of other users already have the role assigned to them.</p>
