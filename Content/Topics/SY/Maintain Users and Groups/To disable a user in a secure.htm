            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />To disable a user in a secure manner:</h1>
        <p>Un<MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the Named User box in the Named User group of fields on the User Details screen.&#160; This will remove the user from the user count for licensing purposes and will disable their user ID so that they cannot log in.</p>
        <p>As added security, various other settings on the user record could be changed as follows to further deny the possibility of them gaining any access (although none of these should be necessary if they are no longer recorded as a named user):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All the groups could be removed from the user -- thus removing their function access and a Group called "LEAVER" could then be added to their user record as their prime group -- this group would be configured to have no function access;</li>
            <li>The user's password could be changed;</li>
            <li>The Domain\User field could be blanked (if this is used);</li>
            <li>The Restricted IP field could be set (preventing login from any other IP address);</li>
            <li>Delete the User Views for this user (see User View Set Up).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may want to consider other places in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> where the user is referred to.&#160; For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the user is set up in the House Sales &gt; Plot Sales &gt; Setup &gt; Sales Staff list in House Sales then this record should be marked as dormant.</li>
            <li>If the user is set up in the Procurement &gt; Setup &gt; People Information System &gt; Buyers list in Procurement, this record should be marked as retired.</li>
        </ul>
