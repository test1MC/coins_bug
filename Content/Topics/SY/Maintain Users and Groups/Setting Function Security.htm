            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Setting Function Security</h1>
        <p>There are various ways to set up access permissions for specific functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">System &gt; User Maintenance &gt; Function Security &gt; Main Menu Security</span> allows you to apply function security for a user or group.  This presents you with a list of the functions on a module, in the order in which they appear on the menu.</li>
            <li>User Function Access is part of <span class="Emphasis">System &gt; User Maintenance &gt; Users</span> and allows you to set an individual user's permissions for all functions.  Group Function Access is the equivalent method in <span class="Emphasis">System &gt; User Maintenance &gt; Groups.</span></li>
            <li><span class="Emphasis">System &gt; User Maintenance &gt; Function Security &gt; Interactive Security Update</span> allows you to control what access a user or group has to functions and subfunctions (such as buttons).</li>
            <li>When you select the user or group you want to grant security for, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> opens a second window in which you can go to the page for which you want to set the permissions, and a third window in which you can set the access that the user or group has to the various functions on that screen.</li>
            <li>Within <span class="Emphasis">OA Reporting &amp; BI &gt; Functions &gt; Function Maintenance</span>, when you update a function, the Function Security by User tab lists the users and groups, and allows you to maintain whether they have access to this function. If the function has sub functions (Add, Update, Delete, Export, Bulk) you can also maintain whether the user or group has access to each of these. The multi-update button <span class="Button">MULTI</span> allows you to set the access for multiple users/groups in a single update.</li>
        </ul>
