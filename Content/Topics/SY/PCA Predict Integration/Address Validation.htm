        <p>If the PCA&#160;Predict address validation service is enabled, address fields in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can be populated and validated automatically.</p>
        <p>You can enter any part of the address and a list of possible matches will be found.  Select an address from the list of results and the address fields in OA will be populated with the selected address. Where appropriate, additional fields such as the country of residence or company name will also be populated.</p>
