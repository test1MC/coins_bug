            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Mobile Form Reporting </h1>
        <p class="Body">Sequence numbers are now shown for sections and fields. These values can be used with RO fields to access values of a completed mobile form.</p>
        <p class="Body">New fields have been added to allow you to optionally store field values on the header of the form. This allows queries to be written to find forms with particular values. For example, if a safety audit form has fields for number on staff on site and construction phase, a query could find audits done during groundworks, where there were more than 50 people working on the site.</p>
        <h1 MadCap:autonum="2">Mobile Form Printing - Simple and Complex</h1>
        <p class="Body">There are changes to the mobile forms print in <span class="Function">Document Designer</span>, to simplify and easily identify the fields used in the mobile form. The mobile form field ID (FID) can be used when designing the output print document, which makes mapping input easier. This is useful for simple forms that do not have repetitive sections  (see <MadCap:xref href="Mobile Forms Document Design Notes.htm#Simple">1.1, <i>Simple</i></MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <p class="Body">Additionally there is complex way already available and detailed in this document (see <MadCap:xref href="Mobile Forms Document Design Notes.htm#Complex">1.2, <i>Complex</i></MadCap:xref>), which is determined by use of Mobile Form Section element.</p>
