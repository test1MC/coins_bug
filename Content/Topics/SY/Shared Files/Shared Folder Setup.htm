        <p class="Body">Saving a record will create a directory, if it does not exist, in $BASE/var/home with the specified directory name (in lower case).&#160; Do not use a user ID as this is where the user’s home directories are also stored.&#160; If you delete a directory, it and its contents will be removed.</p>
        <p class="Body">The <span class="Field">Read Function</span> and <span class="Field">Write Function</span> control which users have access to this directory. These functions must be set up in <span class="Function">Function Maintenance</span>. The functions can be called anything you want; you then need to set the user function access to these functions, to control access to the shared directory.</p>

        <p class="Body">You can use the same function for both read and write permissions, and for different directories, if required.&#160; If the user has access to the function, the corresponding read/write capability will be made available.&#160; The function access is granted in the same way as would normally be done for functions on menus.</p>
