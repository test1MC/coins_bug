        <p class="Body">By default, any query defined will be available for users who have access to run the dynamic query functions.</p>
        <p class="Body">If any of the queries are for more sensitive data, security can be set up for those queries.  If you create a function Q&lt;QueryCode&gt;, for example QJOB for the JOB query, then access to this function can be granted like any other function using groups etc.  If a query is denied then it will not appear in the dynamic query browse and the user will not be able to run it.  It will also be removed from the list of available queries in <span class="Function">Report Builder</span> (see <MadCap:xref href="Dynamic Queries - Report Builder.htm">1, Dynamic Queries - Report Builder</MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <p class="Body">If a user happened on a URL that took them to the dynamic query (see <MadCap:xref href="Dynamic Queries - Functions.htm">1, Dynamic Queries - Functions</MadCap:xref>) then they would receive a security error and the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquiry" />/report would not work.</p>
