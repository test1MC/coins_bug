        <p class="Body">Server-based Exchange integration allows you to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Replicate contacts – this is a one-way process.&#160; Contacts created in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can be replicated to a public folder on the Exchange server.&#160; This folder may then be included as an address book in Outlook.<br /></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Replicate users' appointments and tasks - this is a two-way process. Diary events and journals created in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA will be automatically copied to Exchange. Any updates made in Exchange to these items will also be copied back to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.&#160; Appointments and Tasks created in Exchange can also be flagged for replication back to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> by the use of a “<MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />” category.&#160; This method is an alternative to client-based integration of appointments and tasks which is explained in the guide How To Set Up Outlook Integration.<br /></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Import emails for a project.&#160; Emails put into a public folder (by moving, copying, drag and drop, or by including the public folder’s email address in the TO or CC address list) are imported into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> as marketing journals and can be viewed in Project Management and Marketing.<br /></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Import workflow replies. Workflows can be configured to send emails to users, with links for moving the task to a different stage. These links allow users to send replies to a workflow email address; <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> reads these replies and updates the workflow task as instructed. This means workflow users can control the workflow without having to log into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Import messages from monitored folders.&#160; Any number of public folders can be configured for monitoring.&#160; When the Exchange Integration utility is run, each of these folders is checked for any incoming messages, and the specified program is run to handle the inbound message. Once processed, the message is either moved to an archive folder, if specified, or deleted.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Process sent emails from the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Mail Assistant and load the emails and attachments into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">Importing emails and workflow replies requires public folders with an associated email address.</p>
        <p class="Body">Replication is done by running a scheduled task on a Windows server; this may be the Exchange server or another server on the network.</p>
