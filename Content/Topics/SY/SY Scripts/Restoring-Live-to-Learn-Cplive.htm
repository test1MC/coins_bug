            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Restoring Live to Learn/Cplive</h1>
        <p>This script typically is used when the data on a non-live environment needs updating either for testing purposes or before an upgrade.  

</p>
        <p>The script does not impact any downtime on Live.
</p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="note">Please note this only copies the databases and does not copy any attachments or document management files.

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The first thing the script checks is that the two environments are on the same version.
</p>
        <p>
It then asks you to confirm you are happy to restore the backup over the environment (always check the date of the backup you are restoring)

</p>
        <p>Once you are happy to proceed it then carrys out the following :-

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unzips the backup
</li>
            <li>Shuts down the non-live environment
</li>
            <li>Restores the Live backup to non-live – please note you have to confirm to overwrite the data – again check date and time
</li>
            <li>Update parameters – Y to apply
</li>
            <li>Restarts the non-live environment

</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once completed you should now check that both environments have the same fixes installed.


</p>
        <p><span class="Function">Coinsadmin

        </p>
        <p>If there are any fixes in the non-live environment that are not on Live they will need to be re-installed.
