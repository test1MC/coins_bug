            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Install the OpenEdge SQL Client Access software</h1>
        <p>The Progress OpenEdge SQL Client Access installation package is delivered as a self-extracting ZIP archive. Please ensure that you have the correct installation package for your operating system.</p>
        <p>The Progress OpenEdge environment does not natively support ODBC database connectivity. The OpenEdge SQL Client Access product provides the operating system drivers and software necessary for your computer to connect to the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> database using standard ODBC compliant connections.</p>
        <p>This sequence of steps will instruct you on how to install and configure the Progress OpenEdge SQL Client Access software on a Microsoft Windows based computer.</p>
        <p>The following steps will be performed using Windows Explorer. Alternatively, for advanced Windows users, the Windows Command Prompt can also be used.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a temporary folder to hold the un-packed installation files. For this purposes of this “How-To” guide, the folder C:\OESQL has been created. </li>
            <li>Copy the OpenEdge SQL Client Access installation package into the temporary folder .</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Invoke the installation package by double clicking the filename .</li>
            <li>Extract the installation files into the current folder.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Find the setup.exe program within the extracted installer files and invoke it, by double clicking the filename </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <ul>

        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/SY/LMDSY0042/LMDSY0042-0006.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> It is recommended that you append the OpenEdge version number of the installation to ensure that future versions of OpenEdge products can be clearly identified within your Start Menu.<br /></li>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/SY/LMDSY0042/LMDSY0042-0008.png" class="FullWidth" />

        <ul>
            <li>Select the Finish button to complete the installation and end the installation wizard, closing the installer window.</li>
            <li>Remove the temporary folder that you created in the steps above. Now that the installation has completed, you no longer need the installer files.<br />Ensure that you are not using the temporary folder, for example: you have a command prompt that is currently in the temporary folder, and remove it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have now successfully installed the OpenEdge SQL Client Access product. You are now ready to configure ODBC System DSN’s that can access your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> environments.</p>
