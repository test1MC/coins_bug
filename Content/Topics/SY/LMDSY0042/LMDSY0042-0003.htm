        <h2>Linux / UNIX</h2>
        <p>For the installations on Linux or UNIX, typically you will be installing the Progress OpenEdge SQL Client Access software version based on the bit width of the operating system. As such you will require the 64 bit version of the SQL Client Access product for a 64 bit operating system. Respectively, the 32 bit product should be installed on a 32 bit operating system.</p>
        <p>Where the installation is being performed on a Linux based distribution that supports multiple architectures (both 64 bit and 32 bit software), you will need to choose the appropriate SQL Client Access product based on the bit width of the software requiring ODBC access to your <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> installation. In this case, if the application utilising the ODBC connectivity is a 32 bit application, then you will need to install the 32 bit SQL Client Access product regardless of the bit width of the operating system.</p>
        <h2>Microsoft Windows</h2>
        <p>Microsoft Windows, since Vista, natively supports both 32 bit and 64 bit software on all 64 bit Windows operating system installations. Therefore, if the target platform for the installation is a 64 bit Windows operating system you must verify the bit width of the application software that utilises ODBC connectivity. If this application software is 32 bit, then you must also install the 32 bit SQL Client Access product.</p>
