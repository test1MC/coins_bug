        <p class="Body">When a user whose IP address is defined in the WEBRIPS list logs out, a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box appears on the logout confirmation <MadCap:variable name="Variables.dialogue" />:</p>

        <p class="IndentFieldDef">If this is <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed and the user clicks OK, the next time the user accesses <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> they will see the login screen and will have to log in manually. This means that if a user logs in to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> using someone else's computer, they can ensure that no-one else can access <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> using their credentials. If the user logs out without <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ing this box, the next time they access <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> on the same computer they will not need to log in.</p>
        <p class="Body">When a user whose IP address is defined in the WEBRIPS list logs out, they are taken to the page specified by the SY parameter LOGOUT (or to a default page if LOGOUT is blank). </p>
