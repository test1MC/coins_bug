        <p class="Body">Depending on your company’s policies, you may need to request prior approval for certain types of expense. In this case, you cannot add the claim item to an expense report until prior approval has been granted. </p>
        <p class="Body">You may also request prior approval of a claim item if you have incurred an expense but are not sure if you can claim for it, or if you want to find out if an expense will be reimbursed before you incur the expense. You can request prior approval as long as you have not already added the item to an expense report. </p>
        <p class="Body">If you save a claim item that requires prior approval, CAS Expenses will ask if you want to request prior approval immediately.</p>

        <ul class="ul_1">
            <p class="ListBullet3">If you choose Yes, the status of the claim item changes to Awaiting Prior Approval. When approval is granted, you still need to add the claim item to an expense report.</p>
            <p class="ListBullet3">If you choose No, you will need to request prior approval before you can add the claim item to an expense report.</p>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">To request prior approval for a claim item:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <p class="ListNumber3">In the My Claim Items List, right-click the item and click <span class="Field">Request Prior Approval</span>.</p>
            <p class="ListContinue3">You will be asked to enter some commentary text to explain your request. </p>
            <p class="ListNumber3">Enter your explanation<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p class="ListBullet3"> The prior approval request frame now includes a “Reason” field, with a list of a few reasons. Where do they come from?</p></MadCap:footnote> and click <span class="Field">Submit</span>.</p>

            <p class="ListContinue3">The status of the claim item changes to Awaiting Prior Approval.</p>
        </ol>
        <p class="Body">If a claim item is awaiting prior approval, you cannot modify it.</p>
        <p class="Body">When your approving manager either rejects or approves the claim item, you will receive an email to inform you of the result, including any comments, and the status of the claim item will change to either Prior Approval Rejected or Prior Approval Given.</p>

        <p class="Body">You can see the Approver’s comments (which can explain why the request was rejected or give additional information about the approval) when you open the detail of the item.</p>

        <p class="ListNumber3">To hide the comments, click Acknowledge.</p>
        <p class="Body">If your request is rejected, you can modify the claim (for example, change the amount) and submit it for prior approval again. Alternatively, you can delete the claim item.</p>
        <p class="Body">If your request is approved, you can add the item to an expense report. If you modify the claim item, its status changes back to Draft.<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p class="ListBullet3"> If a claim item with Prior Approval granted is changed, can the approver tell that prior approval has previously been given?</p></MadCap:footnote></p>
