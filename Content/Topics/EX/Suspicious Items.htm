        <p class="Body">To help you identify fraudulent expense claims, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> identifies certain types of item as "potentially suspicious".</p>
        <p class="Body">To help you identify fraudulent expense claims, CAS Expenses considers claim items as potentially suspicious if:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <p class="ListBullet3" MadCap:changes="1">There are two or more claim items on the same report with the same type and date. This might suggest that the claimant has tried to include the item twice, or has separated a single item in two to avoid limits on individual items.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <p class="ListBullet3" MadCap:changes="1">A claim item of the same type and amount already exists (this includes historic claims from any claimant). </p>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">Your company’s policies may be set to ignore potentially suspicious items for certain expense types and claimants: for example, if a claimant regularly claims for a train journey of the same amount.</p>
        <p class="Body">If CAS Expenses detects potentially suspicious items on a report, the report is marked with a warning icon<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p class="ListBullet3"> What other icons are there? What conditions display a warning? Some reports had a warning icon on the right, too; what’s that all about?</p></MadCap:footnote><img src="../../Resources/Images_D-F/OA Expenses/Expense Reports_2.png" style="height: 16px;width: 20px;" class="FullWidth" />.</p>
        <p class="Body">To see the list of potentially suspicious items: </p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <p class="ListNumber3" MadCap:autonum="1. &#160;">View or Review the report. The potentially suspicious items are marked in the date column: </p>

        <ol start="2" class="ol_1">
            <p class="ListNumber3" MadCap:autonum="2. &#160;">Right-click the claim item line and click Investigate. This opens a list of the potentially suspicious items that relate to the claim item.</p>
            <p class="ListNumber3" MadCap:autonum="3. &#160;">When you have decided whether the claim item is actually suspicious, you can reject or approve it as usual. If you decide that the claim is valid and that you do not want similar claim items to be treated as suspicious in future, right-click the claim item line and click Ignore Warnings. Then, if the same claimant includes a claim for the same type and amount in future, it will not be treated as potentially suspicious.</p>
