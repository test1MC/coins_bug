        <p>Expense policies control how CAS Expenses treats claim items. Each claim item must have a policy associated with it.</p>
        <p>Policies affect:</p>
        <p>Who can enter claim items. Claim items can be available to all users in the company; users in specified locations or departments or with specified grades;  or individual named users only.</p>
        <p>How much claimants can claim for a specific expense type, and at what level warnings are issued.</p>
        <p>How much approvers can approve, and the limits on automatic approval.</p>
        <p>what validation is done.</p>
        <p>What additional information is required when entering a claim for a given expense type.</p>
