        <p class="Body">If you are set up as an approver in CAS Expenses, you can approve other employees’ expense reports. Reports you can approve could be submitted by people who have you as their approving manager – these will appear in <span class="Function">Review Expense Reports</span>; or they could be reports that have been delegated or escalated and which have not been reviewed – these will appear in <span class="Function">Management Approval Pooled Claims</span>.</p>
        <p class="Body">When an expense report is submitted for approval, you will receive an email with a PDF of the report.</p>
        <p class="Body">To review an expense report:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <p class="ListNumber3">Open <span class="Function">Review Expense Reports</span> (or <span class="Function">Management Approval Pooled Claims</span>).</p>
            <p class="ListNumber3">Right-click the report and click Review Expense Report. This opens the expense report.</p>
            <p class="ListNumber3">Tick the <span class="Field">Approve</span> or <span class="Field">Reject</span> box on a claim line to approve or reject each claim item in the report. </p>
            <p class="ListContinue3">Note: if your company’s policies allow, you may have an <span class="Button" MadCap:autonum=" 1">Approve All</span> button; you can use this to quickly mark all claim items as approved. You can then still <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> the <span class="Field">Reject</span> box against individual items.</p>
            <p class="ListNumber3">You can add a comment against each line:</p>
            <ol>
                <p class="ListNumber4">Double-click the <span class="Field">Approval Comment</span> column.</p>
                <p class="ListNumber4">Enter the comment.</p>
                <p class="ListNumber4">Click the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> to save the comment.</p>
            </ol>
            <p class="ListNumber3">When you have marked each claim item as approved or rejected, you can submit the report.</p>
            <p class="ListNumber3">If all items on the report are approved, click <span class="Button" MadCap:autonum=" 1">Submit</span>. The report will move on to the next stage in the approval process: it will either be routed to a second approver, or set to Awaiting Payment status.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="ListNumber3">If some items are rejected, you can either:</p>
            <p class="ListContinue3">Route the whole report back to the claimant for them to modify any rejected items: click  <span class="Button" MadCap:autonum=" 1">Submit</span>. A Warning message asks if you want to continue:<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images_D-F/OA Expenses/CAS Expenses Approving Expenses_1.png" style="height: 219px;width: 342px;" class="FullWidth" /></p>
            <p class="ListNumber3">Approve and submit only the approved items: click <span class="Button" MadCap:autonum=" 1">Approve without Rejected</span>. This submits the approved items to the next stage in the process; the rejected items go back to the claimant’s expense items list. This means that you are not holding up payment of the bulk of an expense report for the sake of one or two queried items.</p>
