        <p class="Body">If you are an approving manager, you can delegate approval to other managers; for example, if you are going on holiday. This means that if a claimant submits an expense report to you for approval, the people you delegate to can approve it instead.</p>
        <p class="Body">To delegate approval:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <p class="ListNumber3">Click your user logo and click <span class="Button">User Preferences </span>.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images_D-F/OA Expenses/Expense Reports_5.png" style="height: 180px;width: 407px;" class="FullWidth" /></p>
            <p class="ListNumber3">Click the Expense Approval Delegation tab.</p>
            <p class="ListNumber3">Click <span class="Button"> Turn on Delegation </span>.</p>
            <p class="ListNumber3">Enter the dates between which you want to delegate approval.</p>
            <p class="ListContinue3">The list shows people you can delegate to. Note that you can only delegate to people of the same grade as you, or higher. Tick the box next to the person you want to delegate to. You can delegate to more than one person. You can use the Search fields to limit the people shown in the list.</p>
            <p class="ListNumber3">Tick the box if you want to send an automatic email to the people you are delegating to.</p>
            <p class="ListNumber3">Click <span class="Button"> OK </span>.</p>
        </ol>
        <p class="Body">Anyone you delegate to will receive an email informing them of this.</p>
        <p class="Body">Any existing approval requests remain as your responsibility; only new requests will be routed to the pool of delegates.</p>
