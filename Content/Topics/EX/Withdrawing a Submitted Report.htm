        <p class="Body">If you have submitted an expense report for approval, and then decide that you do not want the report to be processed (perhaps because you have made a mistake), you can withdraw the report, as long as it has not already been paid. You can also withdraw a report that has been rejected.</p>
        <p class="Body">To withdraw an expense report:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <p class="ListNumber3">Open <span class="Function">View My Expense Reports</span>.</p>
            <p class="ListNumber3">Either:</p>
        </ol>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <p class="ListBullet4">Right-click the report line and click Withdraw.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <p class="ListBullet4">View the report and click Withdraw.</p>
        </ul>
        <ol start="3" class="ol_1">
            <p class="ListNumber3">Confirm that you want to withdraw the report.</p>
        </ol>

        <p class="ListContinue3">The report and all its claim items will be set back to draft status. You can then modify the report, and add, modify or delete claim items.</p>
