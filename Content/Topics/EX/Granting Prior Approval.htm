        <p class="Body">Some claim items may need to be approved in advance, before the claimant can add them to an expense report. In addition, claimants may choose to request prior approval – for example, if they want to confirm that they will be reimbursed for a particular purchase before they make it.<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p class="ListBullet3"> If a claim item has had prior approval granted, is that shown on the expense report in any way? What about if it’s had prior approval and then been modified? [GH: No it’s not. If the claimant’s policy dictates that prior approval is mandatory then he/she can’t add a claim item that hasn’t had prior approval already granted. If they get prior approval and then modify the claim item its status is set back to Draft and then, if prior approval is mandatory, they have to request it again.]</p></MadCap:footnote></p>
        <p class="Body">You will receive an email asking you to grant prior approval. You can approve or reject the item using the links in the email, or using <span class="Function">Prior Approval Notifications</span>.</p>
