        <p class="Body">Under certain circumstances an expense report may need to be approved by a second person.<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p class="ListBullet3"> How is the additional approval different? For example, is the report flagged/marked differently? Does it show as already approved by someone else? Where does it appear? [GH: The process is the same. If it is rejected it goes back to the start for the claimant to fix. The claimant can see who’s due to approve it (or the pool name if it’s yet to be pulled down from the pool). If the Approver selects it from Management Approval Pooled Claims then by default it’s already been approved by someone else first. I think you can see the approval history in the Report History tab.])</p></MadCap:footnote> The report will appear in Management Approval Pooled Claims to be reviewed.</p>
