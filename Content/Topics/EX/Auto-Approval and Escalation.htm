        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="&#160;0.1.1 ">Automatic Approval of Low-Value Reports</h3>
        <p class="Body">When a claimant submits an expense report, if the total amount of the report is below a limit (set by your company’s policies), it will be approved automatically and its status set to Awaiting Payment.</p>
        <p class="Body">However, if the total amount of the report is below this auto-approval limit, but the report contains a claim item with an expense type that requires approval, the report will not be approved automatically; it will be routed to an approver.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="&#160;0.1.2 ">Secondary Approval</h3>
        <p class="Body">If the total amount of the expense report is within the approving manager’s approval threshold, when they approve the report it will be set to Awaiting Payment. If the total amount of the report is above the approving manager’s approval threshold, the report will need to be approved by one other person. It will be routed to an approver with the appropriate authority (this depends on the total amount of the report).</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="&#160;0.1.3 ">Escalation</h3>
        <p class="Body">If the approver has not approved an expense report within a pre-defined time limit (set by your company’s policies), the report will be made available for anyone with the same approval level to approve.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3" MadCap:autonum="&#160;0.1.4 ">Automatic Approval of Escalated Reports</h3>
        <p class="Body">If an escalated report has still not been approved after a further time limit, the report can be automatically approved. </p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <p class="ListBullet3" MadCap:changes="1">If Urgent Payment has not been requested, and the time limit for automatic approval falls before the cut-off date for claims, CAS Expenses waits until the cut-off date before approving the report. This gives time for someone to approve the report manually. Note that if automatic approval is triggered after the cut-off date for claims, the report will not be automatically approved until the following cut-off date. </p>
        </ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <p class="ListBullet3" MadCap:changes="1">If Urgent Payment has been requested, CAS Expenses approves the report as soon as the time limit for automatic approval is reached.</p>
