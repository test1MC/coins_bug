        <p class="Body">Depending on your company’s policies, CAS Expenses can automatically approve expense reports after a specified period of time. Usually policies would be set so that if a report has not been approved within a specified time, it will be escalated, and if it has still not been approved after a further period of time, it will automatically be approved. This ensures that claimants are not left out of pocket if the approving manager(s) have not dealt with the expense reports in a reasonable time.</p>
        <p class="Body">If an approver has rejected some claim items on a report, but has not approved the report as a whole, automatic approval will approve all items that are not rejected; rejected items will be routed back to the claimant.</p>
