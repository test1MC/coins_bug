        <p class="Body">If your manager is not available to review and approve your expense report, what happens will depend on your company’s policies and the specific circumstances, but in general there are a number of possibilities.</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li>Your manager may have delegated the approval of expense reports to another staff member, in which case that person should deal with your report.</li>
            <li>If your manager has not delegated approval and has not reviewed your report within a specified time, it will automatically be made available to other reviewers.</li>
            <li>If your report has not been reviewed within a specified time, CAS Expenses may approve it automatically.</li>
            <li>The CAS Expenses administrator may also be able to approve your expense report.</li>
        </ul>
