            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Checking the VAT Return Processing is Complete</h1>
        <p>The following tabs of VAT &gt; VAT Returns Workbench all provide <MadCap:variable name="Variables.colour" /> coded status columns to help you check that your VAT&#160;Return processing is complete:</p>
        <p>VAT&#160;Returns – for all VAT&#160;Returns for VAT&#160;registrations submitted from this company;</p>
        <p>Company Summary – for the latest VAT&#160;Return for each VAT&#160;registration submitted from this company;</p>
        <p>Group Summary - for the latest VAT&#160;Return for each VAT&#160;registration (subject to security access to the submission company for each registration).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Posting Status</p>
        <p>Unposted&#160;- The posting batch has not yet been created.</p>
        <p>Posting&#160;- The&#160;General Ledger&#160;posting batch has been created but has not finished posting.&#160; This should normally be a transitory status unless there is a problem with the batch posting.</p>
        <p>Posted&#160;(with Dig Deeper to&#160;General Ledger&#160;batch) -&#160;The batch transferring the entries from the control accounts configured against each VAT code to the&#160;creditor/ debtor&#160;account configured against the VAT Registration has been posted in the&#160;General Ledger.</p>
        <p>Manually Posted&#160;- The necessary&#160;General Ledger&#160;postings have been dealt with manually.</p>
        <p>Submission Status&#160;:</p>
        <p>Unsent</p>
        <p>Submitting</p>
        <p>Failed</p>
        <p>Complete</p>
        <p>Manually Submitted&#160;- The VAT Return has been submitted by means other than electronic submission direct from <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.&#160; This allows for returns to other jurisdictions as well as for returns re-keyed directly onto the HMRC website.</p>
