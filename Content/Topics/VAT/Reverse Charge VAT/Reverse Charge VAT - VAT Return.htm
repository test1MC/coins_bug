        <p class="Body" style="page-break-after: avoid;text-indent: 0;">The VAT&#160;Return has been changed to ensure that entries relating to EU Goods Acquisition Tax are correct.</p>
        <p class="Body">For any Output VAT transaction on a VAT code which is indicated as EU Goods (in the <span class="Field">EU Goods/Services</span> field):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The VAT amount is excluded from box 1 and included in box 2;</li>
            <li>The Net amount is excluded from box 6 and included in box 9.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Body"> Where there are differences in the rules between different types of reverse charge transactions these can be handled by appropriate configuration of the VAT codes and VAT substitution table.  For example, for the domestic reverse charge the Net Amount on the Output VAT entry would be configured to 0% of the source so that this would not get included in box 6 of the return while for the EU services reverse charge this would be configured to 100% so that it would be included in box 6.</p>
