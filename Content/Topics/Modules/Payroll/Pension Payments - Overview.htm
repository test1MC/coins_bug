        <p class="Body">For a pension type employee where the <span class="Field">Flexibly Accessing Pension</span> flag, the <span class="Field">Pension Death Benefit</span> flag, or the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.PrintOnly">new </MadCap:conditionalText><span class="Field">Serious Ill Health Lump Sum</span> flag is <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed, the correct pay frequency to report can be one-off, irregular or annual instead of the normal pay frequency for the payroll the employee is on. In this situation, a new field is available on the Real Time Information layout in <span class="Function">Employee Maintenance</span>.</p>
