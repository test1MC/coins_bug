        <p class="Body">When loading employee records the fields in the load file must include either ‘kno’ (employee number) or ‘ni-no’ (NI/social security/national ID number). However, records with blank ‘kno’ are now permitted, which means you want to add a new employee and let <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> auto-generate the number. Also, if records have no ‘kno’ field but the ‘ni-no’  is specified, then if there is no matching existing employee this is now taken as an add with the employee number to be auto-generated.</p>
        <p class="Body">When attempting to add a new employee with no specified employee number, auto-numbering applies if configured, otherwise a standard validation error will be issued.</p>
