        <p class="Body"><span class="Function">Move Employees to Another PR&#160;Company</span> is the US/Canadian payroll menu option for moving from one company to another. Previously this used the original employee number in the new company. It now considers the standard employee number validation rules for the new company. If the original employee number is acceptable, this will be used in the new company. If not a new number will be auto-generated. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the phase I changes this auto-numbering only works when <span class="parameter">EMPAUTON</span> is not blank (that is, when standard auto-numbering has been enabled).</li>
            <li>In phase II the auto-numbering works regardless of the setting of <span class="parameter">EMPAUTON</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Body">When auto-generating an employee number and when checking its validity, the function checks for any clash with either another Payroll employee number or another HR personnel ID.
</p>
        <p class="Body">The new employee number is shown in the Message column on the report.
