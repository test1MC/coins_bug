        <p class="Body">The Tax tables are global to <b>ALL</b> <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> companies and <b>ALL</b> payrolls but are specific to a Tax Year. The tax tables are retained for current and prior years; this ensures that payrolls that are still in the prior year and requiring calculation can still be processed based on the relevant tax years figures. This means you can run year end for monthly payroll and advance the new rates for <MadCap:variable name="Payroll YE.curr-yr" />/<MadCap:variable name="Payroll YE.next-short" />, while weekly payroll (pre year-end) can still use <MadCap:variable name="Payroll YE.prev-yr" />/<MadCap:variable name="Payroll YE.curr-short" /> rates for final pay-period calculation purposes.</p>
