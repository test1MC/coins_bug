        <p class="Body">Please note that the “Year End Clear” tickbox is a very important flag also in terms of year-end clearing. Statutory items such as Taxable, NI-able, and NI paid and Tax paid should have the box ticked as this is cumulative only for the tax year and should be reset to zero for the new tax year as of period 1. </p>
        <p class="Body">Company items such as Holiday accrual (if run by calendar or year other than fiscal year) and staff loans reducing balance and calculated should have the box unticked as these balances should be brought forward to the new Tax Year. At this stage the Year End can be run.</p>
