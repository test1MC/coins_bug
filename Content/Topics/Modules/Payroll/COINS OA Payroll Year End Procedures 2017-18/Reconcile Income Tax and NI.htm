        <p class="Body">Use the P35 column totals and the <b>General Ledger</b> reports from the previous two steps to reconcile the payroll reports to your financial ledgers.</p>
        <p class="Body">It is recommended as best practice that you carry out this reconciliation task at the end of every month as part of your normal monthly routine. This will highlight at an early stage if there are any adjustments that you need to make, either in Payroll the General Ledger or both.</p>
        <p class="Body">It is common that payroll personnel are not responsible for the resultant entries in the financial ledgers. However, it is good practice to keep a permanent file note of any unusual circumstances or adjustments that you encounter in payroll processing during the year. This may help the person whose job it is to carry out reconciliation tasks as well as being a reference point for any subsequent Inland Revenue enquiries.</p>
        <p class="Body">Mid-year implementations of payroll require special care as this requires manual population of detailed year-to-date NI information as well as summary totals in the relevant year-to-date pay items. </p>
        <p class="Body">These manual data population exercises should be checked carefully against a full P60 listing, P35 column totals and General Ledger reports at the time of conversion.</p>
