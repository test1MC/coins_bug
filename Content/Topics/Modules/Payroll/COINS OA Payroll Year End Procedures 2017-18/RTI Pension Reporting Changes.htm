        <p class="Body">HMRC has announced a small retrospective change in respect of pension payments.  For a pension type employee where the ‘Pension Death Benefit’ flag is ticked, the ‘Flexibly Accessing Pension’ flag is not ticked, there is zero annual pension and there is no taxable pay component (in either the overall taxable pay or the pension taxable pay field) no start date should be included on the first FPS.</p>
        <p class="Body">For a pension type employee where either the ‘Flexibly Accessing Pension’ flag or the ‘Pension Death Benefit’ flag is ticked the correct pay frequency to report can be one-off, irregular or annual instead of the normal pay frequency for the payroll the employee is on.</p>
