        <p class="Body">There are various wildcards to use with standard or advanced filters in the match fields. Wildcards can also be used when restricting data in reports and some enquiries.</p>
        <p class="Body">These can assist in reducing and filtering the data in the correct way to display the correct data, records and information you require. </p>
        <p class="Body">You may wish to filter on a code that already has a symbol it the code, although setting up codes in this way is not recommended. For example you may wish to search on a range of category codes and your codes are configured using A-001 and A-002. Any symbols such as - , “ ‘ all have a meaning and function within <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, so these are not recommended to be used in addresses, codes and text. You will need to put these in quotes for the search to work, or prefix it with the \. </p>
        <p class="Body">Practicing the filters is recommended so you can understand each feature and use the right wildcard for the right result. Also you may have used filters where a contradiction has occurred. </p>
