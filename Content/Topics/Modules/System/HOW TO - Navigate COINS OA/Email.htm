            <li>Selecting the Email <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> box will enable you to select the email type as well, i.e. HTML. </li>
            <li>The recipient does not have to be a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> user or have access to the specific data, as this will be sent in a PDF format to them. </li>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will automatically create attachments with a standard naming format consisting of the Module and a sequential number (for example SC000360.pdf).&#160; If this is acceptable you need take no further action.&#160; If however, you need to specify a file name (for situations where an external system expects an import file with a specific name for example), the Attachments Name field allows you to specify a name for the PDF and Excel attachments in the email.&#160; </li>
            <li>Add additional comments or message if you wish. </li>
            <li>The report will run in the background and when complete will send the email and also place the report on the Report Status. </li>
