        <p class="Body">The Report screens are designed to collate the fields in the same way as the Advanced Filters screens. Radio Button fields are used to filter reports and these are Either/Or type fields as usually only one can be selected.&#160; Tick Box fields are available and these are Yes/No type fields. All the fields and types are collated and grouped under tabs. </p>

        <p class="Body">Using the fields to filter the data will enable you to run the report collating all the records, information and data required. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter the information you require in the relevant fields. </li>
            <li>Select the Output Option Tab </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Body">The Output Options available are the key factors to consider when running reports as this will determine whether the report is available now, in the future, etc and how the data is collated and stored. </p>
