        <p class="Body">Saving a report allows you to store all the parameters to run the report (for example: supplier selection, sector selection, etc); these are defaulted in to the report selection when you run the report.&#160; In addition it is possible to map date report parameters such as financial dates or start and end period dates to offset calculations that are evaluated at run time with the current date.</p>
        <p class="Body">Report Packs builds on this capability and allows you to construct report packs from the saved or scheduled reports.&#160; These packs can then be run as a single report run, specifying the date to be used for the mapped date calculations.&#160; For example, you might build a month end report pack that requires a month end date for a balance report and a first and last date for a transaction report.&#160; Date offset calculations are defined for these dates and assigned to the data parameters of the saved reports.&#160; At run time you enter a date, perhaps the month end date, and the other dates required are calculated and the appropriate reports are run.</p>
