        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="COINS.Pre-v1105">When using the Lookup fields you will need to select specific records. Selecting records and lines of data is key when searching, inputting and filtering on specific records. </p>
        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="COINS.Pre-v1105">If using the facility to export data or printing specific data, you will need to select multiple records. </p>
        <p class="Body" MadCap:conditions="COINS.Pre-v1105">Using the Tick Box adjacent to a record will only select that specific record. However there are different ways to select multiple records, which can also be selected across pages. </p>
        <p class="Body">You can select several records from a browse screen, then carry out the same action on all of them (for example: delete them, or apply an action from the Action menu).
</p>
        <p class="Body">
			NOTE
		Some actions only work  on a single record, and will display an error if you try to run the action for more than one record.</p>
        <p class="Body">To select a single record, click anywhere on the record.</p>
