        <p class="Body">Filters enable you to reduce the list of records so view exactly the information you require. This applies to either reports or browse screens. You can also set the filters to look for a match of characters, including match case.&#160; </p>
        <p class="Body">There are two types of filters available in the Browse screen, standard and advanced. Standard filters are related to the Search field, so you can specify which field to filter on. The Advanced filters will override any standard filters applied to a screen. </p>
        <p class="Body">Your User Preference will define how you require your filters to be remembered. Go to Setting Filters in the User Preference section for more information. </p>
        <p class="Body">A combination of filters can be used to display the results you require. However care when using multiple filters as you may have a contradiction so nothing is returned. </p>
