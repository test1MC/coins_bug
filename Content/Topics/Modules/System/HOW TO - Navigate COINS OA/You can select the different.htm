            <p class="Note">As you leave a Browse screen is how you will find it. It will not revert back to the first tab. </p>
            <p class="Note">This means if you have selected the Pending Hires tab and you exit the Browse screen, the next time you return to Hire Desk Browse screen, you will be viewing the Pending Hires tab. </p>
            <p class="Note">This is also the case when using the Lookup buttons on selection fields. The lookup tables can have tabs on them, so care should be taken to check the tabs, as it might be sorted or filtered differently to your requirements.</p>
            <p class="Note">This behaviour can be changed through the User Preferences – See “User Preferences” Section later in this guide.</p>
