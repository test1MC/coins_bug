        <p class="Body">In addition to the <MadCap:xref href="Customer Care Developments Tab - Live Summary Counts.htm" class="ParaTextOnly">Customer Care Developments Tab - Live Summary Counts</MadCap:xref>, a number of statistics need a snapshot to be run once a day to re-evaluate the counts etc. This applies particularly to time-dependent information like Issues outside of SLA, where an issue within SLA today may well be out of date tomorrow.  In addition as information changes in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> during the day these counts will need to be updated to ensure the information they show is up to date.</p>
        <p class="Body">As with the live summary counts, link records are also created for some of the counts to ensure the browse behind the count performs acceptably.</p>
        <p class="Body">New reports are available to update the summary counts; see <MadCap:xref href="Customer Care Developments Tab - Customer Care Daily Snapshot.htm">Customer Care Developments Tab - Customer Care Daily Snapshot</MadCap:xref>.</p>
