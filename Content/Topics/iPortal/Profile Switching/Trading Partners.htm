        <p>The Action menu on each applicable subcontractor record contains an option to Switch Profile.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Selecting this option invokes a confirmation dialog.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/iPortal-SP-0002.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The dialog indicates which Profiles are known in the iPortal database; which is the current Profile linked to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA; and which Profiles are available to be linked.</p>
        <p>Selecting the Confirm Change option will:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Send a message to the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA Company Information Workbench to use the newly selected profile.</li>
            <li>Associate with the new profile all questionnaires assigned and completed on behalf of previous profile. Any incomplete questionnaires will be transferred to the newly selected profile and the subcontractor user can still complete them as normal but will need to be representing the correct profile at the time of completion.</li>
            <li>Associate all completed and future assessments with the newly selected profile.</li>
            <li>The previous profile will be put in the contractor’s iPortal Vendor Pool.</li>
            <li>If the newly selected vendor is awaiting secondary approval, the profile switch will allow the secondary approver to approve this profile.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>No notifications will be sent to the vendor telling them about this change.</p>
        <p>Selecting the Close option will close the dialog and no switch will be made.</p>
        <p>In the example shown above, the vendor, 1st Line Defence Ltd, has profiles linked with data-providers Builders Profile and ConstructionLine; the ConstructionLine profile is currently associated with the vendor’s record in the linked <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> CIW; the Builders Profile record is targeted to be newly linked to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> CIW. Pressing the Confirm Change button will remove the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> CIW link to the ConstructionLine record and substitute a link to the Buildres Profile record.</p>
