            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Profile Switching</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Any subcontractor included in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> iPortal database may have a third-party data provider feeding data automatically to update the subcontractor’s details in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> iPortal database; the subcontractor may also update their details direct in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> iPortal. Each such record is termed a Subcontractor Profile. A subcontractor may have a number of Profiles each linked with a different data-provider and/or a Direct Profile. Profile Switching applies only when a subcontractor has more than one Profile in the iPortal database.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Profile Links with <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA</h2>
        <p>Only one <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA Environment may be linked to the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> iPortal and for each subcontractor only one Profile may be linked to any one record in the Company Information Workbench. As data changes are received in the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> iPortal from data-providers, or data is changed for direct profiles, a corresponding data change is triggered in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> OA.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>It may be that a subcontractor who had previously entered data direct to the iPortal signs up with a data-provider to share their details; or a subcontractor who had been registered with one data-provider decides to move to another data-provider. The Profile Switching option allows the contractor to change the iPortal record associated with their <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> CIW record.</p>
