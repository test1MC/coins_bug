            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Maintenance Cycles</h1>
        <p>Maintenance Cycles allows you to set up service cycles foran asset.  Tasks can then be assigned to the cycles.  At the point when due for scheduling - expected next service minus lead time - the associated tasks are created on the asset.  The tasks will be added to a jobcard and the jobcard will record what service cycles were actioned, then on completion the due flag is reset and the next service date and meter set.</p>
