        <p>Asset Maintenance Tasks shows maintenance tasks for an asset.  These tasks can be added manually, created cyclically as part of the service plan, or triggered.</p>
        <p>In order for a Service Plan to be generated, you will need to define a list of Asset specific tasks. These could range from an Inspection, to Routine Servicing.</p>
        <p>Navigate to Fixed Assets &gt; FA Asset Workbench, and select the asset for which you would like to set up.</p>
        <p>Within the asset record, select Maintenance &gt; Task Definitions</p>

        </p>
        <p>Enter the Task code, or use the  look up <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Button Snippets/Button_Lookup_Both.flsnp" /> to locate the Standard Asset Tasks available.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #bed230;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Note: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">If you selected a Standard Asset Task, the Estimated Hours, Cost Estimate, Inspection fields; and the Stock and Checklist details will be populated using the data from the Standard Asset Task.</p>
        <p>Decide which Cycle the task will be linked by selecting from the drop down.</p>
        <p>If you have a service interval of 500 hours, and some actions are performed every 1000  hours, and some every 2000 hours, you can set up three cycles (500, 1000 and 2000 hours), and you can instruct Coins to skip the 500Hr if a 1000Hr is due, likewise skip a 1000Hr when a 2000Hr is due.</p>
        <p>Do this by entering which cycle over-rides the selected in the ‘Skip’ field e.g.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A 500Hr Service will skip a 1000Hr Service</li>
            <li>A 1000Hr Service will skip a 2000 Hr Service (as in the example below)<ul><li>Which also means that a 500Hr Service will also skip a 2000Hr Service, as it skips a 1000Hr Service</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
