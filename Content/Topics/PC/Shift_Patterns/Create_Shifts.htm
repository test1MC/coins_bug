You specify on the report how many days in to the future to create shifts for. This report could be scheduled to run overnight on a weekly basis.</p>
        <p>These shift records define who is available to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.fulfil" /> an operator or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour" /> shift requirement. </p>
        <ul>
