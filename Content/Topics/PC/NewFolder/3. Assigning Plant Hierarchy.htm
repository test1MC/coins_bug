        <h1>Assigning Plant Hierarchy</h1>
        <p>Once the Asset Groups have been imported into <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, you would need to link them to the Web <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Catalogue caps" /> within the below screen.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You can also assign images to the Plant Hierarchy by entering the image name and ".gif" file extension as below:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Misc/Assigning Plant Hierarchy1.png" style="width: 1260px; height: 564px;" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Using the filter at the bottom called “Component Type” this would also need to be done for Stock Groups, Sundry Charges and Kit Groups if required.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This can be done in “Bulk” using the "Bulk" and "Open" functions on the screen.</p>
