        <h1>Linking Triggers to Captions</h1>
        <p>You can set up triggers so that they are updated from the value of a caption field which can be updated on the asset, or during various processes in Plant Manager: dispatch, return, workshop job card, timesheet, daily timesheet, and on the Picking List Workbench (see below).  This means you can record a single value (such as an odometer reading or hours' use) and update several triggers at the same time.  This allows you to trigger separate events based on different values; for example: you could trigger a service every 10,000 miles, and a replacement of parts every 30,000 miles.</p>
        <h2>To link triggers to captions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Define the triggers you want to use.</li>
            <li>Set up a Caption Group, and set the U/W field to Update.</li>
            <li>Set up Captions. The data type of the caption must be the same as the data type of the triggers you want to link to it.</li>
            <li>Click the link on the caption to specify which functions allow you to update the caption, and add the triggers.</li>
        </ol>
