        <p class="Body">New posted cost transactions that match the contra filter criteria are created as unallocated costs and appear on a new <span class="Function">Contra Workbench</span>. You can view all unallocated costs for a specified <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can match unallocated costs with each other using an action as long as the balance of the transactions add up to zero.</p>
        <p class="Body">Unallocated costs that cannot be matched can be linked to a contra record so they can later be recovered. Contra records allow details of the recovery, and an administration charge, to be entered. </p>
        <p class="Body">You then create a <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sales Ledger caps" /></span> invoice for recovery of the costs.</p>
        <p class="Body">When recovery transactions are posted, they will match the original cost transaction to one or more costing distribution records and mark the transactions as Matched.</p>
        <p class="Body"><span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Sales Ledger caps" /></span> invoices for contras will be recovered on <span class="module">Subcontract</span> and <span class="module"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /></span> payment runs by automatic or manual selection for payment of these transactions during the payment process.</p>
