        <h1>Enquiring and Reporting on Triggers</h1>
        <p>Trigger Enquiry shows the assets on which the selected trigger has been specified.  You can filter on those assets on which the trigger has been set off.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Fixed Assets &gt; Reports &gt; Operational Reports &gt; Asset Triggers allows you to produce a report that shows which events are due by reporting on expired triggers. You can report on events that will become due in the future by entering a different date to use. You can produce a word-processing merge file containing the data.</p>
