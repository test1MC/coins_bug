            <p>This “How to…” Guide may contain recommendations about configuration changes.  Your configuration will almost certainly vary from the examples given in this document.  Any configuration changes should always be applied to a separate non-live environment first and tested to prove that the features work as you require.  Should you have any difficulties with this please contact either the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> communication centre or your account manager to arrange for some specialist <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> consultancy.</p>
            <p>Please note that you should not expect the Applications Support team to conduct configuration changes for you.</p>
