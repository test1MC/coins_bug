&lt;PeriodType&gt; - The type of period for which you wish to count the movement. This should be one of TD (to date), CU (always up to todays date regardless of &lt;ToDate&gt;), DR (date range), YR (year to date), FY (first half of year), SY (second half of year), PD (previous days from &lt;ToDate&gt;), CM (calendar month), EM (days from end of month), FP (<MadCap:variable name="Variables.financial period"/>) or WK (week from HS calendar). <BR><BR>&lt;PeriodOffset&gt; - The offset you wish to apply to the period type and date you have selected. For FP and CM period types you can use fixed offsets. For example, !12-1 would give you December or period 12 from last year. <BR><BR>&lt;FromDate&gt; - The start of the date range from which you wish to select events. Only applicable when used with the DR period type. <BR><BR>&lt;ToDate&gt; - The end of the date range from which you wish to select events. When using FP period type this should be a valid <MadCap:variable name="Variables.financial period"/> end date. Default is TODAY.
