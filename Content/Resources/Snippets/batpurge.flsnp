Purging deletes the transaction batch headers. It does not delete the transactions themselves.</p><p>You need only keep the batches for as long as you require <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquiries"/> and reports on them. You should run the purge procedures regularly to clear out batches that you no longer require. Once deleted they cannot be restored or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enquire"/>d upon.
