    <body><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> allows you to enter an order against a company and office that does not have a ledger account number assigned.  When you enter GRNs for the order, they will also have no account number.   When you enter the invoice for the order and specify which account to post it to, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will automatically update the details of the order with the account number; however, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> does not automatically update GRNs at this stage.
