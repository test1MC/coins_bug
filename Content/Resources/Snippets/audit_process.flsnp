Processing an audit assigns the next audit number to any current audit records (that is, records of changes). You should process audits regularly. When you generate audit reports, you can choose to report on an individual audit.</p>
<p>If no changes have been made to the file since the last audit was created, COINS displays the message: <span class="sysmsg">There are no audit records to be processed</span>.</p><p>Once you have created an audit, you should produce an audit report.</p>
