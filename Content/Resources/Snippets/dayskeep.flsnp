The programs that use this parameter consult the date of the record or file.  For example, if set to <span class="userinput">1</span>, files or records dated on or before the day before the current date will be removed, so if the program is run at 23:59 on 1-Jan-17, anything dated on or before 31-Dec-16 will be removed; if run two minutes later at 00:01 on 2-Jan-17, anything dated on or before 1-Jan-17 will be removed.
