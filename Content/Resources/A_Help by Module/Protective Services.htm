        <h1>Protective Services</h1>
        <p>The Campus Security elements track and manage campus incident reporting, federal crime reporting, student discipline, parking allocation, parking fines and more.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Campus Judicial elements encompass a broad range of features to support your campus discipline process. This aspect of the module deals with student infractions such as: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Violations of the honor code and rules of conduct </li>
            <li>Academic integrity matters</li>
            <li>Residence hall violations</li>
            <li>Other disciplinary matters that demand your attention and must be processed and documented</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Campus security and student disciplinary incidents and follow through are easily recorded and managed when all student and campus information resides in a single database in an integrated system. The EMPOWER database contains important details on students, faculty members and all campus locations—offices, classrooms, residence halls, gyms, parking lots, outdoor facilities—to support quick and sure identification and reporting for crime and judicial process management.</p>
