        <h1>Web Portal</h1>
        <p>The EMPOWER Web portal offers access to admissions processes, administrative information, student services, online payments, surveys and a host of other options. Access is managed by the institution to maximize benefit and ease of use for constituents. Individual users can customize their portal experience within the parameters set by the institution. The individual launch page can be configured by the user through a “drag and drop” function to display college information, personal schedules, notices, news feeds and other elements. Common elements like hold notifications can be set as required elements for all users. As always, privacy is a key concern so EMPOWER protects sensitive data and enables only those with proper permissions to view it.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The overall appearance of the Web portal is highly customizable through the use of user-defined style sheets which set the fonts, colors, designs, graphics and other presentation details.  Several standard templates are provided and EMPOWER can prepare complete Web design from art work to custom services</p>
