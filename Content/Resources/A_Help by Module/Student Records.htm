        <h1>Student Records</h1>
        <p>Starting with the college catalog and moving through scheduling, registration, class documentation, grading, transcripts and graduation services, EMPOWER does it all. Add the optional Degree Audit module and your student administration services are complete.</p>
        <p>The fully integrated design of EMPOWER makes relevant data accessible (per college policies and permissions) to all staff members and departments who need it. Let EMPOWER help enforce academic policies through its unsurpassed ability to manage requisites, certifications, program and track requirements, level and status requirements, seat counts, waitlists, GPA and academic standing rules/holds, repeat controls and scores of other details. Errors or non-compliance are clearly flagged and consequences are set by your policies. Overrides, waivers and substitutions are allowed and granted according to your structure and permissions.</p>
