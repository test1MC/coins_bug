        <h1>Alumni Development</h1>
        <p>EMPOWER’s Alumni and Donor Development module places complete alumni and donor data at your fingertips.  Using the same core database and access techniques as the other EMPOWER modules, the wealth of student, family, affiliate and corporate information the college has collected is put into action in alumni functions and fundraising.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>EMPOWER’s strengths in database design shine in this module to give you more data and more control.  Its special features lie in the areas of data segmentation and aggregation, list management, profiles, statistics and analysis.  No matter what sort of information “slicing and dicing” you may need, EMPOWER can supply the data and tools for accurate and fast results.</p>
