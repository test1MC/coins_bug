        <h1><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Mobile mGRN</h1>
        <p>Achieve seamless, paper-free invoice matching with our electronic goods received note app.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Whether you’re looking to increase the efficiency of your invoice matching process, improve the quality of the goods received note (GRN) data you capture, or simply provide your suppliers and customers with a better service, mGRN removes paper from the process helping you to reduce administration costs.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Achieving a full three-way match between purchase order (PO), GRN and invoice is often a challenge when using paper-based documents that can be misplaced or lost. By using a mobile application on a smartphone or tablet you can link GRN information directly to your procurement system. This enables you to accurately record goods received in near real time, even in areas without a mobile signal</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>What does mGRN allow me to do?</h2>
        <p>View purchase orders for specific contracts onsite check goods against the order at the time of delivery. </p>
        <p>Immediately record information about delivered goods against the PO, enter delivery information or photographs of problem items directly on the mobile device.</p>
        <p>Generate an electronic GRN.</p>
        <p>The data stored on mobile devices can be sent back to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> and recorded against PO line items as soon as a mobile signal is established.</p>
        <p>Record costs against jobs quickly.</p>
        <p>Attribute actual costs to jobs rather than using cost calculations from quantity surveyors.</p>
        <h2>What will mGRN mean for my business?</h2>
        <p>Implementing mGRN can help improve efficiency, reduce administrative costs and produce positive results for your suppliers and customers.</p>
        <h3>Better quality data and service delivery insight.</h3>
        <p>The mGRN app’s automated process means that the integrity of the data in your procurement system is ensured. No more typos, wrong allocations, handling exceptions or paying suppliers based on trust.</p>
        <h3>Increased efficiency and productivity</h3>
        <p>By managing GRNs via the mobile device, data doesn’t have to be re-keyed and the amount of time spent chasing deliveries, resolving queries and settling disputes can be minimised - allowing your administrators to focus on their day-to-day tasks.</p>
        <h3>Better supplier and client relationships</h3>
        <p>By using technology to streamline the procurement process, you can demonstrate innovation and service quality to both your supplier and your client. For many clients access to electronic copies of GRNs is now an audit requirement and can make a difference in the bid and contractor selection process.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>As information captured on mobile devices is typically sent back to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> immediately, you can also minimise supplier disputes and resolve problems quickly with evidence at hand; signatures, date-stamped photos and even GPS coordinates of where the delivery was received.</p>
