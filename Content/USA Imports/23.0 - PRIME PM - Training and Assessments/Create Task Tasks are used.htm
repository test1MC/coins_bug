            <li>Create Task - Tasks are used to create lists of things that must be done on a job. You can create a task as an independent item (which will be covered in more detail later), but this action creates a task from an RFI.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;margin-left: 108pt;" start="1">
            <li>The description of the task will default to the code &amp; description of the RFI – this can be edited if required.</li>
            <li>The task needs to be part of a task list, selected by a drop down menu. Task lists are set up against specific projects. </li>
            <li>The status, importance, and impact of the tasks are used to help categorize the task. The options that you choose are selected from pre-defined lists. </li>
            <li>The task will need to be assigned to a person, and the default is the user who creates the task. You can override this via the lookup or by typing the person’s name into the “Assigned To” field.</li>
            <li>The Due Date is used to track the task, and it can be flagged if overdue.</li>
            <li>Once the task has been saved, then an action will be created on the assigned person’s activity workbench. See the “task” section below for more detail. </li>
        </ol>
