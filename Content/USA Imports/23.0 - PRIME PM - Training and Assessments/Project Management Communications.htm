        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="4">
            <li>The communications log contains a number of different communication types. These include RFIs, Submittals,&#160; Transmittals,&#160; Meeting Minutes &amp; Actions, Task lists, Punch lists, Issues lists, Daily Reports, Drawings, Drawing Sets and Other Communications. These different forms of communication can be linked and in many cases one type can be generated from another. </li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;margin-left: 72pt;" start="1">
            <li>For example you may have an issue which leads to an RFI, which is then discussed in a meeting. Once the issue has been resolved the details finalized with a transmittal. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="5">
            <li>Most communication types can have a “due date” or a completion date associated with them. The “open items” tab will show you all items that have not yet been completed. Use the filters at the bottom of the screen to control what items you see in this screen. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>NOTE: This guide is not intended to be an exhaustive list of every interaction between every communication type. In most cases the linking processes are the same, so once this has been covered for one communication type it will not be re-covered in another. </p>
