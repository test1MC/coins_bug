        <h2>RFIs</h2>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>RFIs are Requests For Information. They are used to record, for example, questions that you may ask a client or points that you may wish to clarify. </li>
            <li>To raise an RFI, go to the RFI tab on the Project-specific Communication Management Workbench, and click Add.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="3">
            <li>The RFI Details section of the RFI screen allows for the actual question to be asked: </li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;margin-left: 72pt;" start="1">
            <li>The reference number field at the top of the screen will be blank when the new record is created. This number will be auto-populated when the record is saved. </li>
            <li>Enter a description of the RFI (which will be used when viewing lists of RFIs), and enter the full question or clarification in the “Question” field.</li>
            <li>The RFI may automatically default to be from you, but this can be changed if you need to.</li>
            <li>The suggested answer can be used to give an indication of the format or level of detail that you are expecting as a response to the RFI.</li>
            <li>You need to address the RFI to a particular individual, as specified in the “To” field. You can type in their name or use the lookup to select this person from a list. However the person that you enter here needs to have been entered into the personnel workbench or entered as a contact for a company. </li>

            <li>The RFI Status section of the RFI screen gives information on the importance and status of the RFI:</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;margin-left: 72pt;" start="1">
            <li>The specification section can be used to identify which part of the job the RFI is related to. This may not be relevant if you are not using specification sections.</li>
            <li>The “Status” of the RFI, the “Importance” of the RFI, the “Impact” of the RFI and the “Type” of the RFI are all used to help categorize the RFI. The options that you chose are selected from pre-defined lists. </li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;margin-left: 108pt;" start="1">
            <li>The contents of these lists, and the entries that are selected when you create a new RFI, are all controlled by your company. So see your administrator if you think there is something missing from any of them. </li>

        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;margin-left: 72pt;" start="3">
            <li>The “Open Date” field defaults to the date that the RFI was entered into the system. This can be overwritten if necessary.</li>
            <li> The “Due Date” (which needs to be entered) is used to track RFIs, and there are reports &amp; inquiry screens that show any overdue RFIs.</li>

            <li>From here you can use the various tabs to store more information about the RFI. These extra tabs are common to all communication types, so while they are discussed in the context of an RFI here, the process is also valid for submittals, transmittals, and the like.</li>

        <p>NOTE: Once you have received an answer to your RFI, you can close the RFI. To do this you will need to change the “Status” to “Closed”. When you do this, today’s date is added to the “Closed Date” field, but this can be overwritten if required. This should only be done when you have all the information that you need.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="9">
            <li>The Revisions Tab allows you to update and maintain revisions to the RFI. When you update any "versioned" fields on a revision marked as Current, the corresponding fields are updated on the RFI Details tab screen.</li>
