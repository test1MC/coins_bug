            <li>Create Transmittal from RFI - You can also create a transmittal from an RFI. This is used to create a formal record recording that the RFI has been sent. To do this use the “create transmittal” action – details of the RFI will automatically populate the transmittal screen. More details on transmittals are given in the next section. </li>

            <li>A transmittal is used to formally record that a communication has been sent. A transmittal can be created from any of the other communication types as described above, or it can be created from scratch. The cover sheet for the transmittal can also be generated automatically.</li>
            <li>To create a transmittal from scratch use the Add button on the transmittals tab:</li>
