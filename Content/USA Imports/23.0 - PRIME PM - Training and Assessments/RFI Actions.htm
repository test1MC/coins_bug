            <li>All actions work in the same way regardless of if they are run from this Actions list, or from the  Options Menus on the individual tabs</li>

            <li>Print RFI - allows you to print and/or email a formatted copy of the RFI in PDF format. The layout of the printed RFI is completely configurable, so the example that you see may not look like the example in this guide.</li>

            <li>When you select to print an RFI you are taken to the screen below, which will look familiar to any COINS OA user, as it is based on the main printing Output Options tab.</li>

            <li>Choose the form that you wish to use at the top of the screen – there may be just one form available.</li>
            <li>If you want to email the RFI then select the “email” checkbox. If not, then uncheck this box, and the document will get added to the report queue in the usual way.</li>
            <li>If you do want to email the form then you can add text into the “message” field. It is possible to build templates that pre-populate text for an emailed RFI. If such a template exists, select the HTML checkbox.</li>
            <li>Using the Email Attachments tab, you can add any of the previously attached project documents to this email.</li>
            <li>Once you are happy with your selection options use the Next button to launch the print and/or email.</li>

            <li>Once you have emailed the documents, a journal is automatically created against the RFI to record that the documents were sent. You can see the journal in the Linked Documents list for this RFI. Below, you can see the log from the print/email, and then the email:</li>
