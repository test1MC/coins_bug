        <h1>Reset Payroll</h1>
        <p>Module: Payroll</p>
        <p><span class="function">Payroll Reset</span> "undoes" the [payroll frequency] payroll calculation by setting the employees' status to START and restoring the to-date and associated figures to the position they were in immediately before the pay calculation was run. Running the Reset can be performed in two ways. The fastest and most effective way is to narrow the selection criteria down to the specific area inside of the payroll period to be reset, such as employees on a particular <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />. It is also possible to reset the entire payroll period, which is a large calculation reset for the system. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to [Payroll Frequency] &gt; <span class="function">Reset</span>. </li>
            <li>To narrow the reset down to any changes made, click the Employee Selection tab. Here it is possible to filter the reset process to the specific area in which changes have been made. In the example below, a single employee is being reset using the <span class="field">Employee Number</span> field. <MadCap:dropDown class="screenshot"><MadCap:dropDownHead><MadCap:dropDownHotspot MadCap:autonum="Screenshot: ">Reset Employee(s)</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead><MadCap:dropDownBody><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/6.11 - PRIME PR - Run Edit Details Report (Costing WB)/Reset Payroll.png" class="FullWidth" /></p></MadCap:dropDownBody></MadCap:dropDown></li>
            <li>Alternatively, by simply clicking <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/TextAndButtons/Next.flsnp" /> on the Main screen in the first step, it is possible to reset the entire Payroll period. Again, this is a faster reset when the process is narrowed using the filters in the second step.</li>
            <li>After clicking <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/TextAndButtons/Next.flsnp" />, view the PDF Report by clicking the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/TextAndButtons/RepStat.flsnp" /> icon.<MadCap:dropDown class="screenshot"><MadCap:dropDownHead><MadCap:dropDownHotspot MadCap:autonum="Screenshot: ">View Report</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead><MadCap:dropDownBody><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/6.11 - PRIME PR - Run Edit Details Report (Costing WB)/Reset Payroll_1.png" class="FullWidth" /></p></MadCap:dropDownBody></MadCap:dropDown></li>
