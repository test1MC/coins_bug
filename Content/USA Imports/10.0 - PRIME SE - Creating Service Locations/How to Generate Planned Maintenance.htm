        <h1>How to Generate Planned Maintenance Tasking Service Orders</h1>
        <h2>Module: Service Management</h2>
        <p>Generating PM service orders happens once a month to let us know which agreements we need to go out to service for the month. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="1">
            <li>Go to Service Management &gt; Generate PM Service Orders</li>
        </ol>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="2">
            <li>Under the Main Tab, Enter the date range of the PM Service orders you wish to schedule. Enter the Problem Code to Assign which will be PM. Also you will need to enter the TRADE which in this case will be HVAC. These last two fields are not parameters for the report, but they will appear on the service order when it is created for filtering. The other fields, such as Asset Type and Inspection, will allow you to filter for different types of PM service orders to schedule. These are not mandatory.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="3">
            <li>Check the Generate Service Orders Box (this is if you want to actually create the service orders, for the first few times it may be a good idea to not check this box and verify you are pulling the correct service orders before going back and checking this box and running the function again).</li>

            <li>Under the Agreement Selection Tab, you can further filter which PM Service Orders you are generating. The Termination Status will automatically filter to non-terminated. You can filter for agreement, customer, agreement group, agreement type, service manager or multi-year agreement. None of these fields are mandatory.</li>
