        <h1>Create Location Customer</h1>
        <h2>Module: Service Management</h2>
        <p>After creating a service location the next step is to create a location customer. This ties together customers from Accounts Receivable and the locations in the service management module. Once these are tied together a customer and location can be tied to a service order. A Location is where the work is performed and the Customer is who pays the bill.</p>
