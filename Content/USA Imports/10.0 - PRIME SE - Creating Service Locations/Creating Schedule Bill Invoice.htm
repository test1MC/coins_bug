        <h1>Creating Schedule Bill Invoice</h1>
        <h2>Module: Service Management</h2>
        <p>Once an agreement is in every month you will run a scheduled bill to create all of the invoices that need to go out for these types of agreements. </p>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="2">
            <li>Under the Main Tab, Enter the date range of the PM Scheduled Service orders you wish to create. Enter the Problem Code to Assign which will be PMI (or whatever your pm invoice code is). Also you will need to enter the TRADE which in this case will be HVAC. These last two fields are not parameters for the report, but they will appear on the service order when it is created for filtering. The other fields, are not mandatory.</li>

            <li>Check the Generate Service Orders Box (this is if you want to actually create the service orders, for the first few times it may be a good idea to not check this box and verify you are pulling the correct service orders before going back and checking this box and running the function again).</li>

            <li>Under the Agreement Selection Tab, you can further filter which PM Scheduled Service Orders you are generating. The Termination Status will automatically filter to non-terminated.
