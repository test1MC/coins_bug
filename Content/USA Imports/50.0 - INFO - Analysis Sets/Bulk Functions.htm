        <h1>Bulk Functions</h1>
        <h2>Module: All</h2>
        <p>Bulk functions can be very useful when entering large amounts of data in to COINS. They enable data to be easily exported to an excel document, created/modified, and then reuploaded to COINS.&#160;  </p>

        <p>The three bulk functions are Bulk Add, Bulk Copy, and Bulk Open.</p>
        <p>Bulk Add- (Click the Bulk Button, then click the Add Button) This function will allow the user to add multiple lines of data into a table at once. An excel file will open with column headers under which the information can be entered.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Bulk Copy- (Click the Bulk Button, then click the Copy Button) This function is like the Bulk Add function but it will export a previously entered line to excel giving the user and example of the criteria each column is looking for. This function is also used when moving data from one environment to another.</p>
        <p>Bulk Open- (Click the Bulk Button, then click the Open Button) This function will allow the user to export data to excel, change information on multiple lines, and then re upload back into COINS. **Note** There will be 2 additional columns added at the end of the excel file (column and row ids) If these get deleted the information won’t upload back to COINS correctly.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>**Note** For Bulk Open and Bulk Copy only the lines selected will be exported to excel. If no lines are selected all lines will be exported. In addition, when a filter is applied and either action is performed, only the filtered item will be exported.&#160; </p>
