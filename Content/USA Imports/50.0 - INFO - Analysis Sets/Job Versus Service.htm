        <h1>Job Versus Service</h1>
        <h2>Module: Service Management/ Job Status</h2>
        <p>Job Status and Service Management are two different ways to get workers out to a job site in the COINS software system. Both have their pros and cons and in the following document we will go through the reason to use either or. </p>

        <p>Reasons to Use Job Status</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="1">
            <li>Need to use AIA billing</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 90pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">AIA billing is a standardized method of construction billing using a percentage of completed contract method (progress billing). AIA was created to standardize the paperwork being used in construction and architects, and only exists in the job status module.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="2">
            <li>Forecasting</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 90pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Service management does not have the access to forecasting that job status does. The two forecasting modules are intertwined with job status, while service management does not have access to these modules. These modules are meant to give in-depth information for future budgeting and revenue information and can be adjusted as the job continues. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 90pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Additionally the Business Planning and Forecasting module can be used to keep track of the money you think will be brought in from future jobs and opportunities which can only be done with Job Status. </li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="3">
            <li>Budgeting – Change Orders</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 90pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Service Management does have some budgeting. Agreements can have budgets and so can service orders, but it is limited in the data that can be created, specifically service orders cannot have change orders associated with them. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 90pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Budgeting in Job Status allows for additional processes such as change orders.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="4">
            <li>Dollar amount/ time spent on job</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 90pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Most companies choose to have a certain value where they cut off what types of jobs go into service management versus job status. For example they may say anything that is going to bring in more than $50,000 has to go through job status no matter how quick the job is. Similarly most companies have a cut off for what time is allotted to a service management job. For example they may say if a job is going to last 4 weeks or longer it has to go to job status, even if it is only a 20,000 job. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Reasons to Use Service Management</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="5">
            <li>Speed of Billing</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 90pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When billing through the service management module you can choose different ways to reflect the price. First you can choose to have a quick turnaround and bill from the visit details that the tech and dispatchers can enter. You can also bill after waiting for purchase orders to get committed. Finally you can bill after waiting for costs, such as invoices and payroll information comes through.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="6">
            <li>Schedule and Dispatch Board</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 90pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The Schedule and Dispatch board allows a high rate of flexibility for both the field technicians and the dispatchers working in the office. They can change where technicians need to be and the technicians will get real time information on their mobile device. The S&amp;D board allows technicians to get multiple visits in a day and plan out the most time efficient way to get the work done.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 54pt;" start="7">
            <li>Billing in the Field</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 90pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">One of the best aspects of service is the speed in which you can bill. With the newly created billing in the field technicians can go to a site (for example a customer’s house), finish all of their work and then bill the customer, and take a payment onsite. This sort of functionality is only available through service management</li>
        </ul>
