        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>Over the last few months, we have successfully launched the new Help Portal, both internally and to clients with a Client Area login. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> v11.08 was also released with the functionality of using the portal as a replacement for the in-product online documentation (with Client Area login built into the software) and integration with the COINS side-frame help.</p>
        <p>Flare is now used for the creation of OA-CE documentation as well as for the Flare Knowledge base. We are also investigating whether to Release Notes within Flare. The Flare system is linked to Visual Studio, providing comprehensive source control.</p>
        <p>As we focus on bringing the library further up to date, and the release of a USA version towards the end of the year, we have found the project management and collaboration with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to not be as streamlined as we would like.</p>
        <p>The original concept was to use the Contributor product for topic reviews and updates. However, this requires software to be downloaded onto laptops, and for simple edits/reviews, the software is not intuitive for the SMEs, which has resulted in a lack of engagement with the review process. The review process is critical for both quality and accuracy of content. It is also vital for effective change management. With Flare now being used for a wider range of documentation, our pool of Reviewers has now extended beyond the delivery team and an easier review workflow is required.</p>
        <p>Over the last few months, we have been evaluating Madcap Central as a possible solution. Colleagues from Delivery and Development who have used MadCap Central for reviewing have been positive.</p>
        <h2>Madcap Central</h2>
        <p>MadCap Central is a cloud-based platform that allows us to plan, track, and manage the processes, content, and teams that are involved in topic creation and review. It allows us to extend our authoring capabilities with a cloud-based platform for content and project management, hosting, build automation, task tracking, user permissions, and team collaboration. It works in conjunction with, <b>and is not</b> a replacement for, Flare.</p>
        <h3>Cloud-based Editor for Streamlined Contribution and Review with MadCap Flare</h3>
        <p>The immediate benefit to <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is the ability for anyone in our organisation to contribute and review Flare content using MadCap Central’s cloud-based editor. Subject matter experts, authors, and other non-Flare users can easily add and review content using an integrated cloud-based workflow.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The benefits of this review workflow include:</p>

                <col style="width: 298px;" />
                <col />
            </colgroup>
            <tbody>
                <tr>

                        <p>Cloud-based Editor</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>Subject matter experts do not need to download and install any software. The contribution and review workflow is simple, completely integrated, and takes place in the cloud.</p>

                </tr>
                <tr>

                        <p>Multiple SMEs, authors, and non-Flare users can contribute, make changes, and add comments to the same topic or snippet simultaneously.</p>

                    <td>
                        <p>The lightweight editor offers a streamlined interface, and SMEs only see options and features that are relevant to the contribution and review process.</p>

                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td>
                        <p>Authors can collaborate with SMEs (and other authors) by viewing and working with the same Flare content and projects concurrently.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>

        <h2>Track and Manage Tasks</h2>
        <p>Managing the workload of maintaining Flare and co-ordinating the topics for new releases (and different regions) across the primary authors has so far been done on a "best efforts" basis using a variety of workbenches which allows us some degree of visibility, but not enough to optimise our workflow.</p>
        <p>MadCap Central’s task management features offer an efficient way for us to plan, track, and visualise what needs to be completed with tasks.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/tasks.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Tasks can be created to help organise and streamline the workload. When we create a task in MadCap Central, we have the ability to configure the task with fields such as description, priority level, due dates, associated Flare project, assigned user, and more.</p>
        <p>The Calendar view provides the ability to see when tasks begin and end in relation to one another. This provides a clear view of the team's overall workload and the current commitments for planning purposes.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Project Checklists</h2>
        <p>Checklists are an important part of the documentation creation workflow. They ensure that we have correctly followed the process of creation/review and sign-off of topics and that all items in a workflow have been completed. Checklists can be linked to tasks, allowing us to track items that are outstanding within a specific timeframe - allowing us the opportunity to re-allocate the review or to chase the original reviewer.</p>
        <p>There are two types of checklists available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Project file checklists are automatically associated to specific files (e.g., topics, snippets, master pages) in the project. Custom columns can be added for any number of specific types of activity we want to track, such as “Subject Matter Expert Review” and “Add to TOC”, as well as an optional Note column to include any additional details required for the checklist item.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Custom checklists can be created for anything we would like to track and manage, such as a product release “To Do” lists.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>By setting the appropriate status on each item as we work, we can chart the percentage of completion as we work through the checklist.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/screenshot-projectChecklist.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <h2>Dashboards</h2>
        <p>Top level and Project level dashboards can be configured with widgets – objects that let us see important information at a glance – for quick and easy access to calendars, build history, cloud storage usage, project properties, and more.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/screenshot-centralDash.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Build Automation and Hosting</h2>
        <p>Our current publishing model is to build the Live sites (Internal and UK) on a server hosted on the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> cloud and then publish either to an internal webserver (Internal Portal), or to servers managed by Chris Curd Design (Client Area).</p>
        <p>We have no plans to change this model.</p>
        <p>Central does, however, provide facilities for scheduling build/publish and hosting of Projects. Whilst this is outside of our current model for Live sites, Central would provide a useful testing facility, allowing us to test major release changes and giving others the ability to review those changes without affecting the Live sites.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Pricing (as at 3-Jul-18)</h2>
        <p>Pricing is split between two types of users:</p>
        <p>Author - This is an individual who works in Flare projects, creating and editing content. When necessary, this person can send to Central topics and snippets that need to be reviewed by others. Along with the reviewers, the author can open and edit files in the lightweight editor in Central. Only Authors have access to the Management, Tracking, and Dashboard features of Central.</p>
        <p>Subject Matter Expert - This is an individual whose purpose in Central is to review topics and/or snippets sent by an author. Therefore, an SME only sees the parts of the Central user interface that are necessary for reviews.</p>
        <p>Licensing is on a monthly per user basis:</p>
        <p>Author - $79.00</p>
        <p>SME - $10</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Currently we have three authors (Don, Kathi ,Nigel).</p>
        <p>For SMEs, potentially this could be anyone in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> who is asked to review an item of work. However, SME licences can be disabled/enabled on demand so that a limited number of of licences can be shared out as required within a set of workflows. Initially we would anticipate 20 SME licences would be sufficient to serve the needs of the three authors for review allocation.</p>
        <p>Based on this, the monthly cost would be:</p>
        <p>Authors - $237.00 (£180.00)</p>
        <p>SMEs - $200.00 (£151.50)</p>
        <p>Total - $437.00 (£331.40)</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Yearly cost - $5244.00 (£3976.80)</p>
