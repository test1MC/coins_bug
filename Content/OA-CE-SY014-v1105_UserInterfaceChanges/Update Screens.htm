        <p class="Body">The Save, Undo and Audit buttons are now displayed at the bottom of tabbed update screens (rather than being immediately below the content, which meant they were in displayed in different positions on each tab, and sometimes were off the screen). If the content is larger than the available space, it scrolls vertically, but the buttons remain in place at the bottom of the page.</p>
        <p class="Body">If you try to save a page on which some fields contain incorrect data, or are missing required data, where possible <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> highlights the fields in red, and shows an error message as a tooltip next to the field when you point to it. </p>

        <p class="Body">If the fields with errors are on a different tab, the tab name has a red underline.</p>

        <p class="Body">Field widths have been standard<MadCap:variable name="Variables.is" />ed to avoid a ragged appearance.</p>
