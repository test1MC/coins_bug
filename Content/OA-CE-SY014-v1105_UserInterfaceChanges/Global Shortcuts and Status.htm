        <p class="Body">The status bar at the bottom of the main area, and the “Global Shortcuts” area at the bottom right of the main area, have been removed. The status bar was used for displaying messages, which are now shown as popup alerts. The buttons and icons in the Global Shortcuts area have been moved, either into the page header or onto a new user menu which is available when you move the mouse pointer over the display name or profile picture in the header.</p>
