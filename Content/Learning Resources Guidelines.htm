        <h1>Learning Resources Guidelines</h1>
        <p>The following is a general guide for the creation of Learning Resources:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>As much as possible, any resources created must be generic and use screen shots from the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> SureStart environment or the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Training Environment. Customer data must NOT be used.</li>
            <li>Client specific documentation should be avoided unless the client has paid for the service.</li>
            <li>All documentation is to be supplied to clients in PDF format, or made available via a web-page.</li>
            <li><span style="color: #ff4500;">Under no circumstances should documentation bearing the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> copyright be supplied to clients in ANY format that would allow them to change its contents.</span>
            </li>
            <li>Documentation should be written in the form of Topics rather than a single narrative. Guidance on how this works may be found here &gt; <MadCap:xref href="Topics/Internal Only Topics/Training Delivery - Key Questions/Topic Based Writing.htm">Topic Based Writing</MadCap:xref></li>
            <li>Microsoft Word may be used to create new documentation, as long as it conforms to the topic based authoring guidelines. However, the completed document must then be sent to either Don Barwick, or Nigel Longley so that it can be incorporated into the central resource library. The document will be checked to ensure it meets our criteria for inclusion and the library will create the PDF for issuing to clients and added to the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Help Portal" />.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Existing Documentation bearing the "Created in Madcap Flare" on the copyright page can only be updated via the Flare System. Consultants should request a Review Package from Don or Nigel in order to update these topics.</li>
        </ol>
